Final plan:*
Meher’s house - 25 Leonie Hill
June 10th
Everyone comes at 5:30pm
Ariane and Garance come at 6:30pm
Dress code - Semi formal
Potluck dessert, pizza for dinner. (Everyone’s free to bring things, like snacks n stuff along if they want to :))
Just in case :)
If you choose not to come DO NOT TELL GARANCE AND ARIANE
THEY ARE COMING UNDER THE GUISE OF A REGULAR HANGOUT
kinda cruel but yeah
Thinking about it it's not a party about Marcus rather one about kids who are leaving but whatever
I mean idk ur choice honestly
Hey Katya it might be getting kind of late but if you can ask anyone under Group Admin I think you can have a shot
I can try convincing jessica
Ohhhhh oof
Okay give me a reason to let you in or smth idk
Haha just wanna join for Marcus now huh
Ehm alright so here's the situation
I don't know anything about ariane
But I'm besties with garance
It's combined
So if you can kinda pretend like you're natural then it should be fineeeee
I don't know at least a quarter of the part
Ohhhhh
Ok maybe not then
They definitely wouldn't let you in if you came that late
Cos its a surprise thing
Ah oof
Aight have a good day then
Alright is Marcus a requirement lol
Cos uou know
I had a friend who was super clingy to their crush
It was honestly kina weird but
Ah ok
I'm sure you're not the annoying clingy type for sure
You're chill dwdw
Parties are honestly for the sad
It's what normals do when they have nothing else to do
Keep up the sigma swimmer grindset lol
I'm ngl this is the first time I've gotten incited to a party in months now
Invited
wtf is that not an 11/10 on the party scale
2am Gas station is badass
2AM DORITOS AND ICE CREAM
AGSHSHAGD
NAGSHAHDJWHD
Do you have read receipts off wtf
Man I don't know if that makes me more anxious or less anxious
Do you know what I'm talking abkut
Lmao adios 🤠
Great I'm just introverting over here lol
Alright
I'll do the rest?
I honestly forgot which ones are left
comit tax evadsion 👍
that's actually a problem we have to research in geography
This is why you should take geo
Katya I'm so sorry to disturb you but did you get kicked out of the classcraft classroom?
Katya
Please
I'm so exited
I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO REALISED??
THE PUN
Maybe jujube got it
Cos he was like
Lmao Katya left
But idfk
Good job
Very funny
Yes I am
Shitty joke-makers unite
tell her that next time, she should make it more obvious that its not a typo
eg, italicize the word _exited_
LMFAO
OKAY
Also I ain't forwarding any more messages
Ci ok l
Caput
Xoel
Cool
Not a coinsnfide
Coidn9ence
I'm actually terrible at econs
This is an unironic statement I think I got something stupid like 77 percent on paper 2
But I'd be glad to study, just wanted to make sure you didn't think I was a God at econs or something💀
👍
I legitimately don't think it's a good idea to ask -me- for notes?
But I'll try since you asked 🙂
Also how am I supposed to send them to you????

I haven't even said yes 💀
Have you reeeeeeally made sure that no one else is ok to do this
I don't really take notes
But hey
No problem 👍
If you asked then I'll do it
Lol ok great
agh noooo now I feel bad
3 minutes
look at the TIMESTAMPS dingus
smh
😡😡😡😤
LMAOW HAT
omg i thought you were bringing back tomatohead for a bit there
Idk what ur talking about
It looks so similar
it's uncanny
I might as well be real tomat
😁
Ok so everyone played Poker instead of focusing
Basically there's a test on Thursday
about the development unit
Revision materials were posted today on teamie
No, go ask everyone else
I got 100 dollars in debt
I don't know?
Lol
Where did you go😔
Sorry I was trying to prove that chem was the best department
Oh yeah and
At break
How I ran off and screamed
That was because karthik brought instant noodles to school
So I had to steal them
Oh my god
Oh my god oh my god
I fucked up
So uh
I'm helping out with this french breakfast tomorrow right
And I have no clue where it is
😐😐😐
No now let me just take a break
Or a recess
you might say
Stop it
we're going around in circles with the jokes
it's a bit cyclical
you might say
For some reason I laughed more at 'ergo' than whatever you said before 💀💀💀
I think you're exgeratingsis
fuck
ok whatever
I am humiliated 😭
I'm also kinda crying right now but it's a chess thing so idk if you wanna hear me vent
I decided to go to whatsapp to cope
And THIS happens 😡
But I laughed 👍
Ok so the world chess championship is happening right now
And like I'm rooting for Ding, like the chinese Saul cause better ring ding
And he has a GOOD position
But he loses on the STUPIDEST thing EVER
He runs his timer down to 2 MINUTES
and he has 8 more moves until he gets 60 more minutes
and he must gotten the heebie jeebies cos his next two moves were pure ass
and I'm crying
cause he shoulda won that game
No no no
I love him ❤️
He's like a stick hanyu
He's got emotional regulation problems and he underwent a breakup so uh maybe its too late
Yeah weirdly enough
This guy has max rizz tho
There's photos of him hugging his mom after each game
I would totally fall in love with someone who does that 😭
im the chrizzler 😎
That joke is not original fyi 💀
It's probably for the better to keep my ego in check
IM DYING WHAT THE FUCK???
My mom just told me to stop laughing
Its all ur fault 😤
Ok its not funny the second time
Nah frfr no cap
I can tell you that his personality manifests in his chess though
Marcus
He plays aggressively but kinda the same thing all the time lke he plays this system called the stonewall that is good if your opponent is too passive but some people dislike it cos it's too repetitive but hell is it a strong first few moves ok sorry for the random rant
You DID???? 😳
That's so cute wtf
Did he tell you to play f4 e3 d4 bd3 as white cos he probably did
That's good
I like marcus
I have never won against him
hes just too good
Yeah he is honestly I met him before I learned to not give a shit about what other people think of me and I think his mere presence pushed me to not care
It's so cute its like in a fanfic
Like he's so carefree and I mighta been gay for him if I yknow shared classes with him
what hpapned to your english sksilas
Damn aight
It's okay and it's all marcus' fault its okay 😌
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Manifest
Yeah your family is democracy manifesting 😢
Aight sure
What are tryna get me to vote on
I don't like the second one
That's probably about it
I can't think of anything so bad about the others
ugh fine
First one kinda looks like my aunt to a family gathering
So that one cos she's really nice
Yeah maybe it's just your personality and not the clothes but I'm not so sure
The first one just exudes that feeling tho
Honest opinion, 1 or 3
They both feel different too so whatever ur mood is
Aight np
How's it going
Ma boi scott got an award so you better get one too 😡
Just kidding no pressure
OMG YESSSSS
STICK HANYU ULTIMATE COMEBACK
WHAT THE FU K DID I JUST WITNESS
AND
AND HACKERS
THEY WANTED STICK HANYU TO LOSE SO THEY HACKED HIM AND POSTED HIS PREPARATION ONLINE
I DONT KNOW WHY THEY DONT JUST TAKE HIS MONEY INSTEAD
THIS IS FKIN REAL
https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/12ssian/investigation_might_have_found_ding_and_rapports/
The hackers were french😡😡
NO WHAT STICK HANYU NOOO
ITS A DRAW NOW
HE DIDNT TAKE A FREE ROOK
WHAT WHY
IM GONNA CRY NOOOOOO
this is unironically sad thougu
the dude is too scared of his opponent
plays a safe move instead of attacking
Tell me this was meant unironically😭😭
Lmao ur just quirky like that
I am not in an appropriate situation to open a voice message sorry
What did you say
I
I hope this doesn't jinx anything
But
Hanyu's chess doppelganger is winning again
And I am so happy
But the game ain't over yet
I'm actually ecstatic
These are actual photos taken at different times
lol i feel bad for stick hanyu's opponent though
like he was one point up in the match
and he wanted to rush things to get to a draw so he would win the entire match right
but he didn't think enough in a sharp position and lost 😭
Ok so this isn't a tournament it's a one to one match
In this case first to 7.5 points
1 point for win
0.5 for draw
0 for loss
Ask me about it ig
Nono this is straight up not a tournament
But are people talking about rating?
Yes
That's an oversimplification but yes
Thats my point you gotta look into Arpad Elo normal distribution equation if you want to know more
For ranks
Yayyyy no problem
Basically you have a rating
If you beat some your elo rating
You get like 7 points
If you beat someone with a rating waaaaay higher
Then you get like 20 points
If someone way below you Basically 0
So your elo is how good u are Basically
Why does it capitalise Basically
Yeah 💀💀💀
Lmao
BAHAHAHAHAHAHA WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK
Gah I gotta beat this
Just you wait ‼️
Ayo everything jn my textbook is at least prompted
It might be funny but it makes sense in context
Urs is so quirky I love it
"You didn't make enough babies." 😡
Unless you know what demographic modeling is
In which case it's no longer funny
L we get drawings for our unable-to-comprehend-words asses
Katya
I can't give advice
I have suffered from this same problem for 3 years noe
Sure
i am sexual fluid -olivier
Is that the context?
sounds like you like like her dude
so i think the question is are you in denial because you've only ever viewed women platonically
Being besties can also mean physical attraction yk like those couples r really chill imo
the ones i know at least
like you get each other on a spiritual level automatically
ok heres something i typed but then command v'd because it became irrelevant but i think it might be relevant again
Well the way I found out I liked someone was by physical contact. Like legitimately just the hugging was so 💯 it clears up any doubt.
If there's hugging and there's no spark then there's no physical attraction
👍
well good luck with your interest
or at the very least with introspection
😬 why do you say that
jokes on what
thats it?
and she even said ngl
lmao
just keep ur head up
it's the least you can do
that sounds so cute 🤓
what
i am having a full blown crisis right now katya please clarify
how much of it was the joke katya i think my mind has dissolved
so you're not sure if you like her or not and thats it
jeebers
i thought you pulled one on me
someone pulled that on me once 💀
like asking me for love advice
i think she was tryna bait me into confessing to her or something
but i didnt bit and she gave up it
yeah
but she was my awkward first crush so she probably knew
you had crushes in kindergarten
BAHAHAHA
NOT WHERE I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING
i was halfway through reading your message
before the 'i wanted to be ginger part'
and i touched type 'you had crushes..?'
and then i read it
and i was like oh shit
damn ur so goofy with ur relationships honestly like you are a character in a romcom
like i think that i've seen your archetype in some anime
nooo like u are the cute and quirky character in the anime
chika fujiwara from kaguya sama wa kokuresetai if i may
like shes the but of every joke 💀
but awesomely relatable
and the internet is head over heels for her
well i guess that's it for this part of the conversation right
good luck
with your journeys
and with looking within yourself to find the answer
-master oogway
cya
damn. this is so cute i really want to know who this is now
katya this has been on my ming for the last half hour instead of fukushima daiichi
mind*
yeah of course
pinky promise 🥺
well thats not reassuring
but
idk your choice
i see
thank you i will not inquire further 👍
well im sure she's such a nice person to deserve someone like you ngl
:)
well idk what to vent
i'll think about it when i'm in the mood i double pinky promise i will
alright well good night
:) baiiii
Lol I kinda feel like my studying is unhealthy I legitimately just had the lady at building management say I look on edge
Like we're pretty close cos I chat with her almost every day before going to school but that felt like a fever dream wtf
Lmaooooo I really would have preffered it if she hadn't
preferred*
this is why im failing eng
you're* 🤓☝️
I's* bad
AHA got you to skip an apostrophe
MY INFLUENCE IS INFINITE MUAHHAHA
You know katya, I don't know
Thank you for thinking I am prepared though🤩
Sure
He probably knows
Also please tell me you've googled this
I seriously can't believe your first thought was to go to someone instead of Mr Google
Ah shit so you can type
To someone
😳
I'm not sure how to feel about that but I don't know shit👍
SCROLL???
HAHA WHAT
I'm so sorry for not responding but uh
Olivier sent me this
I say
UwU
👁w👁
Tbf I kinda started it
But go ahead💀💀💀
Wait hwat
What r u doing
What you gon say
Nah i was worse
:D
im finally touching grass katya
r u proud of me
im going outside today
to see boats
i will when im outside
go do it i believe in you 🎉
yo im gonna do this question this is like peak math nerd content so i'll share it with jason too
shiet bruh i can calculate for an environment with zero gravity
but with gravity????!
dayum im obsessed now
the force exerted by the muscle varies with angle relative to gravity
like a n arm at 60 degrees works less than one that is parallel to the groun
yeah i thought quarter circle was ok
but then i thought about it 😭
what
but that's assuming your forearm is always parallel to the ground right
idk im failing physic
a curl has changing angles
i think thats some calculus shit right there
i love howard
mad respect
i love him for making you hate him ❤️
well i
will try to work on it
i will work with jason on this
you'll see 😡
may some cows come zooming in large herds chewing some grass
shit i messed that one up
whatever
You actually physically go to the library ??
What does the library have that hoke doesnt
Home
Lmao imagineee
Actually that's good right
For a swimmer
Cos like you gotta wake up early
Wait no
They chirp later
They just chirp at bad times💀💀💀
True
Lmao
I live on a fairly high floor
You know the first time I went to Singapore
I stayed in yotel
ACTUALLY??
Dayum
And the room was smaller than the bedroom ong
Like me alone
Just basically a capsule
In the Netherlands?
Where
Wait they have boat houses here??
I thought that going to see yachts was cool
But what's cooler is the fact that you can study like that
I have as long an attention span as a goldfish memory
In the library
Sorry that wasn't clear
Scott's dad is like the alpha male business investor ngl everyone wants him so his son gets free everything
Sure where
Wait afk
So wait
Let me get this straight
You just go to the library
In the morning
And chill there and study
That's so cool
I actually admire people who can do that
AAAAA WHAT STICK HANYU💀💀💀
Nah
Idk he played ng5 its a bad move but not the end of the world
Yeah I think
Maybe
You still in library?
Till when
Aight
I got the right acronym finally
R u proud of me
I'm gonna ace chemistry fr
Afk agn brb
Yayy I'm so proud of you
i genuinely still believe that im right
like this isnt a rope pulley fulcrum
the force exerted by the bicep onto a forearm is perpendicular to the forearm right
like think about it this way
put your forearm at 90° (parallel to the ground) and at 45° (upwards)
then curl 45° exactly
which one is more difficult?
katya please i hate being wrong 🥺
at least have an actual argument with me about it
🥺
also i want howards number 😡 this has got me riled up
jk
Nice argument 👍
Sure fine
I give up ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
hhhh
hhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I'll try calculate it my way when I start revising for admaths or physics 💢
also sexy table i love this guy
oh darn no worries then
I think both of your guys' approaches work if you are lifting a dumbell
but not with curls imo
Cos literally
trace the path of a curled dumbbell
its not a straight line
so simply having a straight line distance doesnt make sense
thats what i thought too but
this
i was waving my arm like an idiot
in front of my parent ok
trying to ork this out
how do you know that?
okay
what
it uses more force
thats what it means
damn got me
force is a component of energy here
your biceps are always the same strength????
what could be holding it back
okay
theres gravity if your force is less than acceleration it doesnt work
you need to subtract and shit
force vectors ✨
ok uhm
crap drawing time
ok so never mind but i think i can explain it in words
so remember those force diagrams of cars
the reason you can't lift it is because you are exerting less force than gravity
and so there is net downwards
stronger people have more force
net force up
lift 👍
right?? or am i dumb i think im dumb
Ok I will collate my argument when I have the time i need to case study niger's population growth though
well seems like a website's done my work
https://courses.lumenlearning.com/atd-austincc-physics1/chapter/9-6-forces-and-torques-in-muscles-and-joints/
It involves torque and angle calculations and not simple distance*force
Oh wait there's a bunch of stuff in there that is not in the question
so you guys might be wrong but I'm wrong too
OKMKATYA
I FOUND IT
https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/rocket/torque.html#:~:text=The%20product%20of%20the%20force,the%20torque%20or%20the%20moment.
This is torque against gravity
Typically torque ('energy used') is force times length which the article acknowledges BUT trigonometry must be used for any angles not 90 or 0 relative to the ground
I feel so good being right 😌 take that liberalss] ben shapiro walter hartwell ehite
aight study time fr
sorry for 14 messages 👻
the reason i said calculus was because cosa is constantly changing so you need to add up infinitely many values so integration
Because like, when you are curling a dumbbell then the amount of force constantly changes depending on the angle so you cant just multiply two values you gotta integrate with respect to the curve flcosa
to find energy
also regarding 'it's not moments it's potential energy' doing curls is not the most efficient method to convert potential energy because its not in a straight line
convert to*
katya i believe i am wrong but this has become an actual obsession of mine i will work this out with my mother who has a masters in mechanical engineering
My dad and my mom are arguing over this problem what have you done
My dad is on Howard's side for the reason of mgh=1/2mv^2
My mom is on about this infinite torque sum nonsense
I think the sum will converge to 37.5
Katya katya katya my mom is awake past 11pm this is special
I regret this they're not stopping
I'm fairly sure my whole family has adhd or something
YOU SAID LIFT
NOT CURL
IDIOT😡😡
KATYA THATS DIFFERENT
This is also like sorta with two asterisks my point
I am actually cycling through the 7 stages of grief
I'm nearing acceptance now
but i don't have a concrete answer or why
I've given up
Also if you are worried about your secret because of what's going on with olivier I can assure you that I have not said a word about it honest to god
stick hanyu is on his last game
Would you really
Well I used to think that I my conversations with my last crush would be super cool and casual and everything but I overshared to hell and back and she kinda did too but tbf I overshare alot just not as much as you💀💀
Wdym something I would talk to with my crush
Like actual friend stuff
Like the new rainbow 6 game
Cos I definitely talked about that with her
Ohhhh
Well I guess that's your call
Maybe she's tryna get you to think about attraction in general (she's right next to you💀)
Nah jk ur interpretation
That's a freak out??
You're so calm and collected for a freak out
Aight
Ah
Aaah
Well that really sucks
Not energy I like that abt you lol
Great
Can kinda be naive and dumb sometimes though😭😭
But like
Dumb and smart
Yk
Idk how to say
Like ace econs but probably can't comprehend the DVD screen saver
I'm not surprised
Yeah chika from kaguyasan anime irl confirmed
Do you wish to be a politician when you grow up ⁉️⁉️
Do you not have conversations with other people💀💀
But thanks
YOU WNA BE A POLITICIALN??
I'm telling hanyu this
Ohhhhhh noooooo
Hanyu would be so happy to know ur analog to chika
...
Go say little nerd things to hanyu😭
He'd be more.pissed than me
Yeah he calls people normiee
But that's funny
Aight bye
Katya
I drank coffee today
Probably too much
I feel so shit
I can't do geo like this
It did eventually
Katya I posted this on the group chat but I'll elaborate further
During the science p4 there was an apparent problem with the booklet being sticky, so turning the page would turn two pages instead of one
Raunak noticed this and asked people on a group chat I'm on and some people couldn't remember answering some of the questions
Maybe they just don't remember but there's a solid chance that the sticky booklet caused some people to skip questions
seeing that this is a REOCCURING issue you need to approach the school or exam board IMMEDIATELY and complain to hell and back
Don't go down without a fight ✊
Hope this helps I guess
Or you could resit in november like you said I didn't even realise that was a thing
Well then you should get more sleep before tests💀💀💀
Aw that's sweet
In both ways now I think about it
Well you asked if he won and then you started talking about your potential crush and I thought it would be inappropriate to butt in with him winning
Rg6 was epic gamer though😡😡
I feel so
so
accomplished
Nah I converted katya
Paul Morphy 2😳😳
You'll get that reference sometime no worries
Paul Morphy is the proprietor of the "romantic" school of chess
Yeah that's so lame😭
I can be self aware but you weren't supposed to acknowledge😡😡😡😡
My ego is gone
Oh shit terminator katya has arrived
Absolutely ruthless
Ok so I was gonna make a dick joke but then I realized that your sexuality is a bit uncertain so I held that thought💀💀
"Wow no man must ever satisfy you huh"

Well I am interested now

But cya
🫡
Gotcha
It'd be wrong to not tolerate them. I will structure this message with lettered points:
a) listening to them and choosing to associate with them is something different
b) they're actually really funny people (HOLD UP LISTEN TO ME)
c) in 2012 John Koenig wrote _The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows_, which is a list of new words for emotions that lack words. He coined the word 'sonder' which went viral on insta a while back I think. In the context of Philip and Amartya, both of them perceive humour in a way that WE cannot understand, and same for them to us (we probably look like emo reddit edgelords or something) and their perception is the amalgamation of everything that has ever happened to them INCLUDING their upbringing and to not tolerate them is a blatant act of neglect and reductionism that amounts their views as being nil. So what they're doing IS funny and not dumb just not to us and these negative externalities (economics 🤓) that they inflict on us is actually just kinda us not liking their humour like what have they actually done? Have they made fun of us? Have they kicked us? On Amartya's side I can say with a 99% certainty that no he isn't and it's just kinda mean that he's inherently bad for following his own beliefs and stuff aaaaaaaaaa what is this rant I read Laforgueian philosophy once and I think it's destroyed my brain wtf
it makes no sense
its incoherent
they're witty funny to each other
my point condensed
that's true
i luv ms campbell ❤️
ok yeah i actually don't like tony
its all about perspective in the end
what i wrote doesn't make sense in that light
he humps guys without their permission
under the pretesne that he's 'gay'
also he's kinda racist?
?!?!?!?!?!
damn
Katya
Did you say you were planning to resit a test on November?
Someone else is planning to do so but isn't getting a ton of empathy from friends💀
So do you mind if I introduce them to you?
Ok I asked him
Well that's what he says too
Do you know Andrew by the way?
Aight gotcha since I shared ur number with him I have to share his to you right
Andrew Ho.vcf (file attached)
But he might not text
Nah don't
I mean it's his choice so I wouldn't push anything
Lol I'm not relevant in this situation
LMAO
HAHAHAH
Sorry I had DM notifications off
That's goofy though
You are completely correct
Alright good night
Jawsome
🍖bleton
My phone was on silent💀
I legit just read this
Why didn't you give me shit about this in the lockers??
That's true
Do you take admaths?
Yeah lmao
If you thought today was two days think about all les étudiants de mathématiques additionnels😬
Actually I'm sorry
I realise you had Chinese yesterday
That's kinda hard
chinese sounds even worse to me though
like its a freaking language dude you're not expected to do listening or orals in maths are you
Good luck with Chinese🧄
this suggests that your dad has to use the word 'forgetting' alot
is he okay bruh
very
you know that feeling when you see a photo of someone
and you think you know who it is
but aren't 100% sure
so a conundrum reveals itself whereby on one hand you are like 'ahah it's prianka I know who that is. I'm so smart 😁😁' and on the other hand it's not prianka and i look like a fool
wadozismean
someone once said to me chow neymar what does he mean
it means grass mud horse
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_Mud_Horse
Ikr
chow down on deez lmao gotem
🤩🤩🤩🤩💅🤩💅🤩💅🐐🐐
knees duts lmao goteeeeem
Oh yeah how was chinese
so it's all bing chiling?
Fast and furious
Katya how was it
Saul good
I put perms for one question instead of comb though
So that's like 3 marks off I think😔
Not to mention I make shit tons of silly mistakes too
Did I show you pictures of actual mistakes made while practicing
They're so bad
Which exam
Lmfao I redrew the econs graph question like 4 times
The table surface might as well have been made of shavings at that point
As in which exam was awful? French?
Same but it was more me being really underconfident in myself and I initially drew the graph too small
So I redraw it again
But then the demand curves were too close
So then I redraw it again
You get the point
I didn't think it was too bad honestly I think admaths students are stressed in general
Lmfao the one that always shakes his head and is condescending as he'll?
Hell
Square glass frames?
Always sounds really frustrated?
Ooooof yeahh
lmfaoo they might as well be
Idk why he's so angry thougu
Oh ok then that's completely understandable ngl
I used to take the same school bus as weichun
It wasn't fun
Yeah it's why I'm the way I am now💀💀
Scared to initiate contact in fear of meeting another weichun
WHAT
Just like that?
UGH
Lmao I bought a rubiks cube for thilos birthday recently and the thought of that shit breaking is so infuriating
That cost like 50 bucks
That's actually even worse if it had sentimental value
Who??
If weichun then how??
Ohh that's surprisingly nice of him
No one can forget ganju once they hear it though
I'm mildly doing admaths rn so sorry if I'm slow to reply
AHAHAHAHAHA
I think I'll go
Cya
God I want a bird so badly now why do you do this to me
Supporting the bird race is worth it if they keep on pecking you😁
But they might peck me too😭
Just kidding ushsjdjw
Yeah ok then maybe not
Did I tell you that my dad had a pet macaque once
Well imma ask my dad then
He doesn't have any😔
They're in his family home in Indonesia most likely
Don't you just hate it when
Your grandparents come over
And the first thing they say is 'yo you're alot fatter' but they treat it like a good thing because back in the day being fat was good
But being fat ISNT necessarily good anymore??
They're really chill though
And plus I'm not super self conscious
👍🧄
why are sex maniac and holy man mutually exclusive
hell I'd have tons of respect for Jesus if he got mad bitches
Damn he grooving hard
Those two guys are cuddling him??
Ooooh spicyy
I don't know how to communicate this but keeping in mind the context I burst out laughing upon reading 'rub off'
When's the test
RA RA RASPUTIN
Damn
Good luck
KATYA HERES THE PART WHERE YOU SAY GOOD LUCK TO ME BECAUSE MY GREAT IS TOMORROW😡😡😡😡

BTW if this is about Kaira then actually condolences should go to her actual friends
Because they were with her when it happened
It's awful for everyone
I feel lucky that no close friend has ever passed away like that
Let alone what it feels like as a family member
I don't know if moving on is a respectful thing to do
I want to talk about something else
Which I think I'm gonna do now
Aight cya
I really liked the blue box one-shot because the girl was like that
Sportsy gals and guys are super cool

I LOVE THIS
Ok
My mom is staring at me because of the faces I'm making
Is this a comedy????
No tucking way it ain't a comedy
Lit students be like💀💀💀
😮😮
So much sex what the fuck
Woah
There were multiple climaxes there
That's such a convoluted uh
Nononon, they were so interesting
LMAO???
Waiy
What's this book called
Gotcha
Nah you beat me
But sure
Aight ima mark a paper then I'll get to you
Ok I thought of one
It's similar to yours
In the 'attractive person lures someone to kill themselves'
Sorry for slow typing though
I'm brushing my teeth lmfao
Ok so it's called Boys Abyss
It's another comic (I don't have the concentration to read books 🫡)
So there's a boy who falls in love with an idol
It's a hopeless love right cos no way the idol sees him
But this kid is roaming around
And he SEES HER
In fact actually she beckons him over
And she seduces him
They have sex
And this kid can't believe it (he's a high school student now to be clear)
Wait ima shower rq
Ok I chill in bed it's all good now
So this idol that he just had sex with is really weird
She says
I want you to jump off this famous bridge with me
And we both kill ourselves
So he's like aight
So they go to the bridge and she says that he has to go first
I don't remember exactly what happened exactly but he ends up escaping somehow
And he's like I'm NEVER going back (spoiler: he goes back)
This kid is one of those types of people that think they will never have a girlfriend but it turns out that he has a female childhood friend
Her nickname is Chako. It means something like a mochi sweet in japanese
That's because she's pretty chubby
I used to have stickers of her but I changed phones a while back. She's pretty cute actually
Chako likes the kid and tries to you know be with him
But this kid is battling his thoughts regarding what the fuck just happened
Also his mom is abusive
So he runs to his classroom teacher
She seduces him and they have sex
Now the teacher becomes crazy and tries to take him away from his parents asap
And make him her sex slave or something
Shiet I'm in bed now idk if I should continue writing
I'll do it tomorrow when you're there for it
Good night 🫡🫡
I literally wasn't awake yet when you sent those messages
Oook I'm so sorry 🥹
So he goes back to Chakos place (his lovers place)
And Chako is the most sweet and cute ball of human that he has ever seen
But he doesn't love her
Chako unlike the others doesn't try to seduce him, but instead gets ruthlessly friend zoned over and over again despite being, you know, a decent human being
So she thinks it's her weight
When the kid finally has the courage to get out and go back to his parents then she locks herself in her room and doesn't go out for the rest of the semester
I'll give you a before and after
She's also been very obviously mentally damaged after not going out of her room for ages
But in a super cruel twist the kid NOW wants to have sex with her
Also not to mention Chako's parents are Christian evangelist preacher assholes that believe in the sanctity and purity of mind or something
But they ban anything so for example they once saw a gravure model book in her room and they physically abuses her for it
Now here's where the story really begins (yeah its really long)
Wait shit there are so many side stories I think I skipped over the main one
Let's rewind back here
Chako and the kid both have their idols
For chako it's the one he lost his virginity to and for chako it's a famous novelist
She looooooves books (I think the author wanted to make her super adorable and cute I think he succeeded 🥹)
Literally soo innocent and kind I don't know how the kid doesn't fall in love with her after facing abuse. Probably the trauma
So suddenly the kid gets a text from the idol but something strange also happens
Chako gets a text from someone claiming to be HER author idol
And so they're both like WHAAAAT THATS CRAZY IMA GO SEE HIM/HER RIGHT NOW
That was a fucked up mistake 👍
So they both go the next evening to see the people they admire so much
Chako arrives first and it's the real deal
But he's not the person she thinks he is
He lives in this run down house that's beginning to rot, and he only eats instant noodles and natto
She also sees this super beautiful woman next to him
Like SUPER SUPER beautiful
Intermission time I gotta eat something for breakfast at least👍
Intermission over
So chako is like huh that's weird but we're chill cos I don't like like my idol I just think he's a really good author right
So they have a very wholesome conversation and she leaves
Meanwhile the kid is taking an intentionally long route to the place he is supposed to go
Because he's fairly certain that she's gonna try and kill him
But he's like fuck it I'm gonna get seduced again
So he goes there but really late
He arrives at the run down house and with his idol is a really scruffy looking author
(They're the same people that Chako met)
And then the kid has sex with the idol again in front of the author
Now this scene was so heartbreaking that it won an award in the kodainsha manga awards iirc
Now I'm gonna fast forward to what I know because it's an ongoing series and if I keep describing this to you in the level of detail I'll be here till after the exams start
Let's go back here
Teacher is fucking crazy and tries to seduce and kidnap the kid
Also mind you chako has lost her weight and her mind
So now chako loses her virginity to the kids cousin cos he looks like him
But now he repeatedly sexually assaults her
Teacher reports to the authorities that parents are abusing the kid (they are but this is framed in a way where the teachers abuse is objectively worse)
And she tries to take custody
So she fakes a 'survey' where the parents put their signature. I'm sure you know how she's gonna use that signature
And so it culminates in this panel which is so famous that it's associated with the entire manga
Lemme find it
Also I notice how similar chako post transformation and the teacher look. Chako wants to look like the teacher because she gets the kid
That's about where I am with the manga
I skipped about 10 chapters of senseless abuse directed at chako
But yeah I have about 20 more chapters left to read until I'm fully caught up
So yeah🥹🥹👍
Gladly once tomorrow is over with
Yeah lmao imagine taking history
L
Oh shit I'm aorry
Wait why then
PowerPoint night?
That's so cool
You've got an interesting friend group
I'm doing just nandos or whatever lmfao

Okay basically I messed up one question that I did before
It sucks cos I did it before
Fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me
Yk
Like I hate it
And also alot of questions in general were uncertain
But it's fineeee
Noo what's wrong
Yeah but we don't talk about that cos we don't wanna pull our hair out right 😎
Fool me once... uh, fool me once, uh... fool me, fuck I forgor💀
You better🫡🫡
SEE HE WANTS TO TALK WITH YOU
Absolute power move on your part lmao
Lamb of god
Wait what happened? If you don't mind
Ah I see
I only know lamb of God in the unironic Christian sense
What lamb of God r u talking about
Oh no
I see
Sunday school has done things to me
I'm listening to music rn ima pull it up rq
Metal 😎😎😎
My cousin used to play in a metal band
Sorry my parents momeng
Usually like eclectic Jazz or something stupid
Basically royes music (im a 40yo yes)
I used to listen to system of a down though
Alot
Because my cousin listened to it
I
CRY
WHEN ANGELS DESERVE TO DIEEEEEEEEEER
RAHHHHHHHHH
I loved the energy
I also might have been a little brain damaged
WAKE UP
I haven't listened to metal in ages though
Thanks for reawakening that💀
Wait I really wanna send videos of my cousins shredding
Would he allow that?
This from wayyyyy back
What is that woah
I need to know the tornado of souls now
I actually don't know
The text below it came with the video
I was like
Idk
He really is
I feel really bad for him though would you mind a rant?
Ok so my grandpa is one of those Chinese countryside people right
Like expects children to be a doctor or.something
My cousins strength is not STEM
It's very much music
So much so a song he was a guest guitarist for got like 100k streams on spotify
But my grandpa is like that means NOTHING
And our family on my moms side is an intense patriarchy so my grandpa has a lot of say
So my grandpa is genuinely not proud of him despite his achievements reaching at least 100k people????
And I feel so bad for him
Fievel is glauque on their audiotape album I think it was
Audiotree
But yeah
It's so sad
I feel like my grandpa is the reason everyone else is in stem
Including me
Because like we're just scare of being unvalidated
My cousin is the oldest of his grandchildren btw
So I feel like our parents are steering us to stem to please gramos
Gramps
Grammaw is so chill though I love her
Damm yeah my grandpa's children really hate him actually
But there's that intrinsic bias for some reason I feel
Just like he's still really.important
Sorryk I gotta find Staley

Yeah my bad my bad
Doesn't get soggy at all

I live under the metaphorical wrong when it comes to fashion
Rock*
I'm generally under the literal wrong

I feel so bad now
If there was a way to make you not cry I woulda done that
Also hell you cry alot
I thought I was soft
no offense lmao
you're really strong as a person so i just didn't expect it but it's good you can get your emotions out healthily
pms?
Oh that really sucks
I don't think ms life skills taught me enough about the emotional effects of the menstrual cycle
So I want to say I understand but I don't
I also want to say power through but I know it aint that simple
Wow that's hard
Well I don't think you can reduce yourself because other people have it worse
It still really sucks
I think you should go to a therapist if that's not how you think already 💀
that';s an exaggeration but
you get my point
My day's going great
I'm home alone and I get to do whatever the shit I want
Also gaining weight in the process 💪 but I don't care 👍
So ur just chilling in the mrt?
Have any plans for today?
Ooooooooo
Okay have fun!

I'm not going to for a few reasons
a. they're all nice
b. storage in the hard drive is poopy 😢
But know that I'm looking through them rn
Where even are you???
DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY NONE OF THEM WERE???
Okay this is funny for a few reasons
I literally couldn't comprehend the idea of going outside
So I thought you dropped it inside the house and I was like
Where???? Why????
It's me that doesn't go outside😢
Swim?
Sorry if afk I'm looking thru pics
I see how's it
What does that mean
What is the consequence of lane 5
Have you swam yet??
I'm so confused
I see how it is
That's good
Ohhhh my days
It feels different to me because all the gamers say oh my days
so I immediately think slurs and raging
WHAT
SHES 11?
AND SHES AS TALL AS YOU
I THOUGH HAVING MY 13yo COUSIN BE TALLER THAN ME WAS BAD
I am taller than my 19yo cousin though
So I think there's some weird reverse height thing going on
Noooooooo
You can diss me but you can't diss my parents, sorry
How dare you 😡
Jk
Katya are there any other photos of you other than the ones you sent on the gc and the one where you're on your own table?
I can't find them
Also I know this sounds like a negative comment but it really isn't but why don't you smile with your teeth?
You deleted this message
that sounds so weird
corrected version: We all want to see katya's biiiiig smile
it's probably contagious
Ah okay then
I've had a moderate overbite for almost my entire life
so I feel compelled to show my teeth
because they just wanna get out of there lmao
What depends?
Oh same then
Actually I used to have a similar problem but a few things happened
well not problem
situation
a. my mom tells me to smile with my teeth
b. i'm actually happy enough to not fake smile when I'm with my friends
Yeah it's not that I'm suggesting you're unhappy I was just putting my situation out there
Thanks, should this change my decision to get invisalign in about a month and a half?
It shouldn't right
lmao
A lower canine tooth is getting problematic though
so from a MEDICAL standpoint I kinda need it
Lol
I heard it's uncomfortable af though
but I'm ready 💪
Tank??
What thank
tank
NO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SHRIMPS
no
NO
KATYA
ok be honest
no judgement
BAHAHA I THOUGHT CARIDINA WAS A DISEASE
why did they call one of them NEW caridina 💀
not so shrimple
do you know the shrimp song
kero kero bonito
How many shrimps do you have to eat
Nah its the lyrics to the song
I love it so much
https://youtube.com/watch?v=_leCDwul69I
ok cya
I used to listen to this song alot in middle school
Katya how large is this video file
Yoooooooooooo
what is that song
Sorry it took like a full minute to download
Does this mean I'm uncultured
because I (god save me) don't listen to Nirvana
Where'd you learn it from
cos it's pretty cool
Ah as always
We should make a drums guitar duet
Do you play any other instrument?
It's never too late to start an instrument
My cousin learned the guitar when he was 15 and 3 years later he goes onto spotify with a kajillion listens as a guest guitarist
Ikr
No offense but he's the goat at music
but as I said he's being denied by gramps
Which one
cause there's a live version and a not live version
the not live version is not him
Ohhhh
I though the actual spotify one
Yeah that's really cool
I have tons of them
Wait gtg
I'll look for it
Sorry I didn't read this
I've been on the road (yes its really late but this is an epic roadtrip)
Can't open videos on data
Will get to it when I sleep then wake up
Gotta ask my dad for the wifi password and he's asleep rn
Also don't be afraid to remind me that I didn't respond to ur message even though I talked on another gc
Are you planning to practice guitar over the break?
Also the aircon here is so loud
I want to show myself doing something cool but I can't think of anything
It's pretty much only video games
:DD
Thank you
Woo 🥳
Good luck
I wanna record myself jamming on the drums when I get back to singapore
It is really fun
Ok will check it out
It's really simple as instruments go though
I've already gotten Thilo to start playing drums
Also do you have a spotify account?
WHY
Also the internet here is so slow I'm really sorry the music is pausing and everything
What's a song with good drums
that's played by tool
Okok
I LOVE CHANGING TIME SIGNATURES
OK I GOT IT PLAYING
The transition between time signatures that are multiples of 2 and those that are multiples of 3 are so satisfying to play
The really weird ones I can only really do for one bar 💀
Cus I play jazz ✨
And so I inherently love triplets
Ok I'll look for one
Also spotify on my laptop is not working so
Imma listen to rosetta stoned on my phone
Spotify isn't working on my phone either cos the internet is so bad
So I'm looking thru songs that are in my downloaded playlist
For reference these messages were sent at noon sharp
It's not showing for you because internet momeng
Ok I'm back from lunch 👍
It works now
Which is great
There are some movie soundtracks by Sven Libaek which alternate between swing 3s and 2s alot
I'll give a good example
The last 30 seconds of Where the Daring Go
Is pretty satisfying I think
But it's not my favorite song
But it's good
IH SHIT I GOTTA
Okok
I'm doing that right now
Ooh that's spicy
Wow
Ok if you're looking for this kind of weird time signatures
I've got a competitor
Anything by the weather report
Or brand X
Which one?
Birdland?
Lol teen Town is great you're the first person to ever say it sounds good haha
AHAHAHA
NO WAY
Also ima switch to laptop rq
Birdland was the thing my drums teacher tried to test me with once
with the sign reading
because it's fairly simple
but the one hard thing about it is the time signatures
sight*
It is and thank you (lmao)
Where the bird at
I unironically like rosetta stoned actually
I'm doing the thing where I count with the song
and it's therapeutic too
Mother mother?
Yoooo 7mins in is so good
repeated syncopation is what gets me going
I love it so much
Wait he's THAT kind of bird?
What's the name of that kind of bird
WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES
So do they just get to fly around the house>
?
What bout kili
Oh no
what did ozai do
to deserve the c a g e
for he eating
my question is
why does ozai get a cage for going out or eating but kili doesn't
So ozai is just naughty
Is he?
I want to know about the birds' perosnalities
That's soooooooo cute
SO YOU CAN JUST HUG THE BIRB?
Dude that's concerning
Lol
The birds have that privilege
The way they talk is the same way people talk in a fever dream
Lucky you, you have no balls to get chopped off
I think? 😮
AAAAA DOGS
I love doggos
I've never had one though 😔
Exactly
But I still feel salty that my parents won't let me have one
Probably still worth it
I'm kinda in an uncomfortable position to text rn I'll explain later so I gtg sorry
Was checking out the goat that's gonna be sacrificed on the 29th for idul adha
Katya
There are really cool things that I've found but I don't know who to share it with
So I'll send it to you because at least I know you're going to react, even if it's olivier instagram video type reaction
Dated May 5 1983
It reads something along the lines of "thank you for the wisdom you have given to our child Anti(?) Hartini Christianti"
I think the gift giver is part of the air force because the addresses are both in the airfield part of jakarta
For context gramps was apparently a really good headmaster in schools around North jakarta
Nope
I'm literally the only person that isn't a Mario character
And a BOOK
That's so cool
I wanna dance to the mlp sound track
The game of go isn't looking to good for you, chief
Muahaha my ego shall grow boundlessly
Do you wanna play on?
Also this is kinda wild I don't have nieces or nephews yet
That sounds unironically fun
I still have a lego Porsche 911 set that i haven't built yet
Haven't done anything with it in the year since I bought it since I just didn't have the time
But it's in Singapore and I'm in jakarta 😭😭
You deleted this message
Sorry idk how to share from the mobile app
https://online-go.com/game/54677832
If you don't mind can we end the game? Ogs is sending me annoying notifications and I don't know how to change the notification settings
Wait how long were you in india??
Or wherever you went I actually am not sure where you went
Ah icic
No problem, it never really bothered me
Also it's the holidays so just chill bruh
Ooh where
Do you know Sabine hossenberger or whatever her name is
It's relevant I promise
Good luck!!
Ok she's a science youtuber but she had a pretty controversial stance on hydrogen as a fuel source
basically she thinks that hydrogen isn't as clean and whatnot as everyone says it is
not discrediting ur internship tho its rly cool just thought it was relevant
She said it was only cleaner by like 7% or something
because the source of hydrogen is from fossil fuels right now
which is terribly ironic
the alternatives that are available right now are actual underground hydrogen (rare) or water processing byproduct (expensive and also polluting)
but tell me about it
whatchu gonna do
Sure
but also what do you do in an internship
cya
Katya this is so cool
I should have taken the opportunity to sign up for an internship this year
I see
YESSS 💪
Ayyyyy my cousin showed this one to me ages ago
Now tell me what your job is
I wanna know
Surely there's something better than that right 😱
Actually I don't know what internships are like maybe that's par for the course
Ohhh okay that's good I thought your job will be to organise cards
Dayummmm
I feel left out 😢
Coping hard in the meantime
Laughing at louis' language model
you wanna hear bout it?
Want the dorky details boiled down or given raw?
Okay
Well Louis made a language model with the tensor nodes n stuff basically its his own chatgpt
but
to make language models you need to train it on data
chatgpt trained it on a kajillion bytes of data
Louis trained it on this discord server
which has me in it and other true gamers 😎
the problem with training a model on gamers is that it will speak like gamers
and gamers are not so well known for their coherence
they are ALSO not well known for their kindness or compassion
so he's posting the results of him 'chatting' with the model and it's so hilarious
Okok
```Bonk-Boi-3000: whats 2+2

Bonk-Boi-3000: nop, latr
You: what time
Bonk-Boi-3000: you are damaged
You: how so
Bonk-Boi-3000: sick man
You: chill```
not to mention he urges louis to get on game
then says 'nop, latr'
this is so on point though
I wanna train it on you ngl

I bet it's not worse than the gamer one
Is that a chalelnge?
challenge*

Summertime coding project is to copy louis then 💀

sourerc

Gotcha 👍
I'll probably still ask louis but in the offchance I actually do it then I'll send results
Which I probably will do if it takes less than a day to do
Katya
how many messages have you typed to me?
Is it more or less than one thousand
Ok katya I'm on it

KATYAAA
I can't do this without your motivation
