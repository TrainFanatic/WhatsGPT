6/9/22, 2:27 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Is it okay if I come late?

6/9/22, 6:25 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Because if not then I get if it’s like a private thing
6/9/22, 6:25 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Especially because they’re leaving
6/9/22, 6:25 PM - Christopher Ginting: Ehm alright so here's the situation
6/9/22, 6:25 PM - Christopher Ginting: I don't know anything about ariane
6/9/22, 6:25 PM - Christopher Ginting: But I'm besties with garance
6/9/22, 6:25 PM - Christopher Ginting: It's combined
6/9/22, 6:26 PM - Christopher Ginting: So if you can kinda pretend like you're natural then it should be fineeeee
6/9/22, 6:26 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I mean it would be okay but I would only be able to reach by like 7:30…
6/9/22, 6:26 PM - Christopher Ginting: I don't know at least a quarter of the part
6/9/22, 6:26 PM - Christopher Ginting: Ohhhhh

6/9/22, 6:30 PM - Christopher Ginting: Cos uou know
6/9/22, 6:30 PM - Christopher Ginting: I had a friend who was super clingy to their crush
6/9/22, 6:30 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Marcus is not a requirement
6/9/22, 6:30 PM - Christopher Ginting: It was honestly kina weird but
6/9/22, 6:30 PM - Christopher Ginting: Ah ok

6/9/22, 6:31 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Thanks
6/9/22, 6:31 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I appreciate that I come off as non-annoying and unclingy
6/9/22, 6:32 PM - Christopher Ginting: You're chill dwdw
6/9/22, 6:32 PM - Angry Board Gamer: :)))
6/9/22, 6:32 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Because I swear I never get invited to parties and it’s kinda sad
6/9/22, 6:32 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I think it’s because everyone assumes that I need 8 hours of sleep before swimming and won’t skip it
6/9/22, 6:32 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I’ll get 2 hours and still go
6/9/22, 6:33 PM - Christopher Ginting: Parties are honestly for the sad
6/9/22, 6:33 PM - Christopher Ginting: It's what normals do when they have nothing else to do
6/9/22, 6:33 PM - Christopher Ginting: Keep up the sigma swimmer grindset lol

4/28/23, 10:24 AM - Christopher Ginting: and he wanted to rush things to get to a draw so he would win the entire match right
4/28/23, 10:24 AM - Christopher Ginting: but he didn't think enough in a sharp position and lost 😭
4/28/23, 8:29 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Wait that’s kind of sad actually
4/28/23, 8:29 PM - Angry Board Gamer: How do chess tournaments work though
4/28/23, 8:29 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Is it by rankings as well?
4/28/23, 8:30 PM - Christopher Ginting: Ok so this isn't a tournament it's a one to one match
4/28/23, 8:30 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Because ppl are always talking about rankings and idk what they mean
4/28/23, 8:30 PM - Christopher Ginting: In this case first to 7.5 points
4/28/23, 8:30 PM - Christopher Ginting: 1 point for win
4/28/23, 8:30 PM - Christopher Ginting: 0.5 for draw
4/28/23, 8:30 PM - Christopher Ginting: 0 for loss
4/28/23, 8:30 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Ahh ok so are points like based on individual matches then?
4/28/23, 8:30 PM - Christopher Ginting: Ask me about it ig
4/28/23, 8:30 PM - Christopher Ginting: Nono this is straight up not a tournament
4/28/23, 8:31 PM - Angry Board Gamer: OHH
4/28/23, 8:31 PM - Angry Board Gamer: That makes sense then
4/28/23, 8:31 PM - Christopher Ginting: But are people talking about rating?
4/28/23, 8:31 PM - Angry Board Gamer: So it’s based on if you kill the other players stuff?
4/28/23, 8:31 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Idk I feel like it comes up a lot
4/28/23, 8:32 PM - Angry Board Gamer: How do you get ranked, is it on how many matches you win?
4/28/23, 8:32 PM - Christopher Ginting: Yes

4/28/23, 8:32 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Okk
4/28/23, 8:32 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Chess is so confusing to me I don’t understand it
4/28/23, 8:33 PM - Christopher Ginting: Thats my point you gotta look into Arpad Elo normal distribution equation if you want to know more
4/28/23, 8:33 PM - Christopher Ginting: For ranks
4/28/23, 8:33 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Thanks not confused anymore got it 👍

4/28/23, 8:33 PM - Angry Board Gamer: What on earth is that though
4/28/23, 8:34 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Wait I’ll google I feel like it’s interesting
4/28/23, 8:34 PM - Christopher Ginting: Basically you have a rating
4/28/23, 8:34 PM - Christopher Ginting: If you beat some your elo rating
4/28/23, 8:34 PM - Christopher Ginting: You get like 7 points
4/28/23, 8:35 PM - Christopher Ginting: If you beat someone with a rating waaaaay higher
4/28/23, 8:35 PM - Christopher Ginting: Then you get like 20 points
4/28/23, 8:35 PM - Christopher Ginting: If someone way below you Basically 0
4/28/23, 8:35 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Ohh that’s kind of smart
4/28/23, 8:35 PM - Christopher Ginting: So your elo is how good u are Basically
4/28/23, 8:35 PM - Christopher Ginting: Why does it capitalise Basically
4/28/23, 8:35 PM - Angry Board Gamer: <Media omitted>
4/28/23, 8:36 PM - Christopher Ginting: Yeah 💀💀💀
4/28/23, 8:36 PM - Angry Board Gamer: My autocorrect does that a bunch too it’s so random
4/28/23, 8:36 PM - Angry Board Gamer: This makes my brain want to throw up but in a good way
4/28/23, 8:37 PM - Christopher Ginting: Lmao
4/28/23, 8:39 PM - Christopher Ginting: <Media omitted>
4/28/23, 8:40 PM - Angry Board Gamer: HAHAHA so iconic
4/28/23, 8:40 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Wait the history textbook had something I’ll find it
4/28/23, 8:41 PM - Angry Board Gamer: <Media omitted>
4/28/23, 8:41 PM - Angry Board Gamer: They’re failures Chris you’ve got to understand
4/28/23, 8:42 PM - Christopher Ginting: BAHAHAHAHAHAHA WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK
4/28/23, 8:42 PM - Angry Board Gamer: RIGHT ITS SO RANDOM
4/28/23, 8:43 PM - Christopher Ginting: Gah I gotta beat this
4/28/23, 8:43 PM - Christopher Ginting: Just you wait ‼️
4/28/23, 8:43 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Noo im scared
4/28/23, 8:45 PM - Christopher Ginting: Ayo everything jn my textbook is at least prompted
4/28/23, 8:45 PM - Christopher Ginting: It might be funny but it makes sense in context
4/28/23, 8:46 PM - Christopher Ginting: Urs is so quirky I love it
4/28/23, 8:46 PM - Angry Board Gamer: This is why I take history
4/28/23, 8:46 PM - Angry Board Gamer: But this is actually too funny like the guy lecturing them
4/28/23, 8:46 PM - Christopher Ginting: <Media omitted>
4/28/23, 8:46 PM - Christopher Ginting: "You didn't make enough babies." 😡
4/28/23, 8:47 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Wow the Geo textbook is like a whole comic
4/28/23, 8:47 PM - Angry Board Gamer: That’s actually really cool
4/28/23, 8:47 PM - Christopher Ginting: <Media omitted>
4/28/23, 8:48 PM - Christopher Ginting: Unless you know what demographic modeling is
4/28/23, 8:48 PM - Christopher Ginting: In which case it's no longer funny
4/28/23, 8:48 PM - Angry Board Gamer: <Media omitted>
4/28/23, 8:48 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Hehehe
4/28/23, 8:48 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I don’t know what shape that is but I love it
4/28/23, 8:49 PM - Christopher Ginting: L we get drawings for our unable-to-comprehend-words asses
4/28/23, 8:49 PM - Angry Board Gamer: No but it’s actually so difficult to process sometimes
4/28/23, 8:49 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Also Chris sorry this is really random
4/28/23, 8:49 PM - Angry Board Gamer: But like
4/28/23, 8:50 PM - Angry Board Gamer: When do you know if you like like someone or if you’re just really good friends
4/28/23, 8:50 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Cause I’m confused with this one person
4/28/23, 8:50 PM - Christopher Ginting: Katya
4/28/23, 8:50 PM - Christopher Ginting: I can't give advice
4/28/23, 8:50 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Noo pls
4/28/23, 8:51 PM - Christopher Ginting: I have suffered from this same problem for 3 years noe
4/28/23, 8:51 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I’ll take whatever advice you have
4/28/23, 8:51 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Ok wait I’ll give you context if that helps
4/28/23, 8:51 PM - Christopher Ginting: Sure
4/28/23, 8:52 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Cause so you know how I’m not like straight straight ahaha bit of an understatement but whatevs so I really really really thought Iiked this girl last year but I found out she liked someone else and I was like ok whatever got over it so I thought maybe I didn’t really like her that way but idk I’ve been hanging out with her a lot and I honestly can’t tell anymore
4/28/23, 8:54 PM - Angry Board Gamer: And I honestly don’t know like when Olivier asked me if I was gay in econs I panicked cause idk what to say like I like guys but idk if I like girls too and I don’t know if I’m bi or straight or whatever
4/28/23, 8:54 PM - Christopher Ginting: i am sexual fluid -olivier
4/28/23, 8:54 PM - Angry Board Gamer: True true
4/28/23, 8:54 PM - Christopher Ginting: Is that the context?
4/28/23, 8:54 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Yeah
4/28/23, 8:56 PM - Angry Board Gamer: It’s just like every time we hang out I’m like ASKFIS we’d be so cute if we were dating and she’s so pretty and every time she asks me for help with stuff it makes me feel really good and idk I kind of get a little jealous if she’s like joking around with other ppl like ohh are we about to kiss rn and stuff but on the other hand idk if I just really like her as a friend
4/28/23, 8:56 PM - Christopher Ginting: sounds like you like like her dude
4/28/23, 8:57 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Noo but that’s the thing I can’t tell because it’s usually really straightforward for me if it’s with guys but I can’t anymore like it’s so confusing
4/28/23, 8:58 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Cause I love hanging out with her as friends and doing friend activities like gossiping and maths past papers and shit
4/28/23, 8:58 PM - Angry Board Gamer: You know??
4/28/23, 8:58 PM - Christopher Ginting: so i think the question is are you in denial because you've only ever viewed women platonically
4/28/23, 8:59 PM - Christopher Ginting: Being besties can also mean physical attraction yk like those couples r really chill imo
4/28/23, 8:59 PM - Christopher Ginting: the ones i know at least
4/28/23, 8:59 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Ok yeah I get what you mean
4/28/23, 8:59 PM - Christopher Ginting: like you get each other on a spiritual level automatically
4/28/23, 9:00 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Idk maybe?? Cause like I’m out to my parents and my brother and like my close friends but I don’t know if maybe Im just not really used to the idea if that makes sense
4/28/23, 9:00 PM - Christopher Ginting: ok heres something i typed but then command v'd because it became irrelevant but i think it might be relevant again
4/28/23, 9:00 PM - Christopher Ginting: Well the way I found out I liked someone was by physical contact. Like legitimately just the hugging was so 💯 it clears up any doubt.

If there's hugging and there's no spark then there's no physical attraction
4/28/23, 9:00 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Okk that’s actually really helpful
4/28/23, 9:01 PM - Christopher Ginting: 👍
4/28/23, 9:01 PM - Christopher Ginting: well good luck with your interest
4/28/23, 9:01 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I mean either way I don’t really think she likes me back haha
4/28/23, 9:01 PM - Angry Board Gamer: But thanks anyways :))
4/28/23, 9:01 PM - Christopher Ginting: or at the very least with introspection
4/28/23, 9:01 PM - Christopher Ginting: 😬 why do you say that
4/28/23, 9:02 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Idk I’m pretty sure she isn’t straight but like besides a few times last year when she made jokes and stuff where I was like ohh is she being serious I think that’s just her humour
4/28/23, 9:03 PM - Christopher Ginting: jokes on what
4/28/23, 9:03 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Like ok a while back she posted a butt ugly pic of me on her story and I replied ‘smash’ and she replied ‘me too ngl’ but that’s just her humour i think
4/28/23, 9:03 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Idk it was the ngl that threw me off
4/28/23, 9:03 PM - Angry Board Gamer: But I think she was joking anyways
4/28/23, 9:03 PM - Christopher Ginting: thats it?
4/28/23, 9:03 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Sorry sorry I really don’t mean to dump all this on you
4/28/23, 9:03 PM - Christopher Ginting: and she even said ngl
4/28/23, 9:03 PM - Christopher Ginting: lmao
4/28/23, 9:04 PM - Christopher Ginting: just keep ur head up
4/28/23, 9:04 PM - Christopher Ginting: it's the least you can do
4/28/23, 9:04 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Noo it’s just jokes like that and stuff and I felt like we had a moment when we went for paintball but again I kinda feel like we didn’t
4/28/23, 9:04 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Ugh idk how to describe it
4/28/23, 9:04 PM - Angry Board Gamer: It’s just I can’t tell anymore
4/28/23, 9:05 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Like she sent me a bunch of videos on what she’s reading after completely unprompted and I’m like girl?? Do you want me to fall in love with you??
4/28/23, 9:05 PM - Angry Board Gamer: And it was so cute
4/28/23, 9:05 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I’m not in love with her btw
4/28/23, 9:05 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I was kidding
4/28/23, 9:05 PM - Christopher Ginting: that sounds so cute 🤓
4/28/23, 9:05 PM - Christopher Ginting: what
4/28/23, 9:05 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Just to clarify
4/28/23, 9:05 PM - Angry Board Gamer: In case you didn’t get it was a joke
4/28/23, 9:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: i am having a full blown crisis right now katya please clarify
4/28/23, 9:06 PM - Angry Board Gamer: IM NOT IN LOVE WITH HER
4/28/23, 9:06 PM - Angry Board Gamer: IT WAS A JOKE
4/28/23, 9:07 PM - Angry Board Gamer: THIS IS THE CLARIFICATION
4/28/23, 9:07 PM - Christopher Ginting: how much of it was the joke katya i think my mind has dissolved
4/28/23, 9:07 PM - Angry Board Gamer: JUST THE IN LOVE WORH HER PART
4/28/23, 9:08 PM - Angry Board Gamer: THE REST IS NOT A JOKE
4/28/23, 9:08 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I WOULSNT DO THAT
4/28/23, 9:08 PM - Christopher Ginting: so you're not sure if you like her or not and thats it
4/28/23, 9:08 PM - Christopher Ginting: jeebers
4/28/23, 9:08 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Yeahhh
4/28/23, 9:08 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Sorry for any confusion
4/28/23, 9:08 PM - Christopher Ginting: i thought you pulled one on me
4/28/23, 9:08 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Anything you want to vent I’m here for a while?
4/28/23, 9:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Noo I wouldn’t that would be really insensitive
4/28/23, 9:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: someone pulled that on me once 💀
4/28/23, 9:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Noo wtf
4/28/23, 9:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: like asking me for love advice
4/28/23, 9:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: That’s so meann
4/28/23, 9:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: i think she was tryna bait me into confessing to her or something
4/28/23, 9:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: but i didnt bit and she gave up it
4/28/23, 9:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Ok that’s just creepy
4/28/23, 9:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: yeah
4/28/23, 9:10 PM - Christopher Ginting: but she was my awkward first crush so she probably knew
4/28/23, 9:10 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Aww I’m sorry that actually sucks
4/28/23, 9:10 PM - Angry Board Gamer: If it helps my first crush was this guy in kindergarten because he was ginger and I just thought it was cool because I wanted to be ginger
4/28/23, 9:11 PM - Angry Board Gamer: So I thought it would like spread to me if he was my boyfriend
4/28/23, 9:11 PM - Christopher Ginting: you had crushes in kindergarten
4/28/23, 9:11 PM - Christopher Ginting: BAHAHAHA
4/28/23, 9:11 PM - Christopher Ginting: NOT WHERE I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING
4/28/23, 9:11 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Unfortunately, they were quite childish though as you can see
4/28/23, 9:11 PM - Angry Board Gamer: WHAT DID YOU THINK
4/28/23, 9:12 PM - Christopher Ginting: i was halfway through reading your message
4/28/23, 9:12 PM - Christopher Ginting: before the 'i wanted to be ginger part'
4/28/23, 9:12 PM - Christopher Ginting: and i touched type 'you had crushes..?'
4/28/23, 9:12 PM - Christopher Ginting: and then i read it
4/28/23, 9:12 PM - Christopher Ginting: and i was like oh shit
4/28/23, 9:13 PM - Christopher Ginting: damn ur so goofy with ur relationships honestly like you are a character in a romcom
4/28/23, 9:13 PM - Christopher Ginting: like i think that i've seen your archetype in some anime
4/28/23, 9:13 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I honestly have no idea if that’s an insult or a compliment
4/28/23, 9:13 PM - Angry Board Gamer: No it’s actually quite bad this is why shit doesn’t work out
4/28/23, 9:14 PM - Christopher Ginting: nooo like u are the cute and quirky character in the anime

4/29/23, 10:15 AM - Angry Board Gamer: At least that’s what I’m telling myself
4/29/23, 10:16 AM - Angry Board Gamer: The other day I was a little annoyed at my brother cause he kept asking me to help him with stuff when I had work and I thought I was hiding it well but his girlfriend told me I looked really stressed ahaha
4/29/23, 10:17 AM - Angry Board Gamer: It’s cool that she noticed though that’s really nice of her
4/29/23, 10:18 AM - Christopher Ginting: Lmaooooo I really would have preffered it if she hadn't

4/29/23, 11:53 AM - Angry Board Gamer: Are they soluble in everything aside from sulfates and g7 for pms and just sulphate for ca st ba
4/29/23, 11:53 AM - Angry Board Gamer: Idk if that makes sense but I’m so confused
4/29/23, 11:53 AM - Angry Board Gamer: <Media omitted>
4/29/23, 11:53 AM - Christopher Ginting: You know katya, I don't know

4/29/23, 12:02 PM - Christopher Ginting: What you gon say
4/29/23, 12:02 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Gonna send it to him and ask him what on earth he’s on
4/29/23, 12:02 PM - Christopher Ginting: Nah i was worse
4/29/23, 12:02 PM - Christopher Ginting: <Media omitted>
4/29/23, 12:03 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Wow
4/29/23, 12:03 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Don’t even know what to say to that
4/29/23, 12:03 PM - Christopher Ginting: :D
4/29/23, 12:04 PM - Christopher Ginting: im finally touching grass katya
4/29/23, 12:04 PM - Christopher Ginting: r u proud of me
4/29/23, 12:04 PM - Christopher Ginting: im going outside today
4/29/23, 12:04 PM - Christopher Ginting: to see boats
4/29/23, 12:04 PM - Angry Board Gamer: <Media omitted>
4/29/23, 12:04 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Send proof
4/29/23, 12:04 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I don’t believe you
4/29/23, 12:04 PM - Angry Board Gamer: So proud 🥹
4/29/23, 12:05 PM - Angry Board Gamer: If this is a video game where you run outside I’m gonna be mad
4/29/23, 12:05 PM - Christopher Ginting: i will when im outside
4/29/23, 12:05 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Fine fine
4/29/23, 12:05 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I have to go do more chem now :(
4/29/23, 12:05 PM - Christopher Ginting: go do it i believe in you 🎉
4/29/23, 12:05 PM - Angry Board Gamer: 🫡
4/29/23, 12:15 PM - Christopher Ginting: yo im gonna do this question this is like peak math nerd content so i'll share it with jason too
4/29/23, 12:17 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Wait can I send you what I got not sure if it’s correct
4/29/23, 12:17 PM - Angry Board Gamer: But if you’re not done yet I won’t spoil it for you
4/29/23, 12:20 PM - Christopher Ginting: shiet bruh i can calculate for an environment with zero gravity
4/29/23, 12:20 PM - Christopher Ginting: but with gravity????!
4/29/23, 12:20 PM - Christopher Ginting: dayum im obsessed now
4/29/23, 12:23 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Wait why do you need to hung about gravity
4/29/23, 12:23 PM - Angry Board Gamer: *think
4/29/23, 12:23 PM - Christopher Ginting: the force exerted by the muscle varies with angle relative to gravity
4/29/23, 12:24 PM - Christopher Ginting: like a n arm at 60 degrees works less than one that is parallel to the groun
4/29/23, 12:24 PM - Angry Board Gamer: NOO I thought I had it
4/29/23, 12:24 PM - Christopher Ginting: yeah i thought quarter circle was ok
4/29/23, 12:24 PM - Christopher Ginting: but then i thought about it 😭
4/29/23, 12:24 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Because I just found the moment and one joule is one nm
4/29/23, 12:24 PM - Angry Board Gamer: So I thought it was just that
4/29/23, 12:25 PM - Angry Board Gamer: But now I have no clue
4/29/23, 12:25 PM - Christopher Ginting: what
4/29/23, 12:25 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Is it not just that??
4/29/23, 12:25 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Wait I’ll draw it
4/29/23, 12:26 PM - Angry Board Gamer: <Media omitted>
4/29/23, 12:27 PM - Christopher Ginting: but that's assuming your forearm is always parallel to the ground right
4/29/23, 12:27 PM - Christopher Ginting: idk im failing physic
4/29/23, 12:27 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Oh true
4/29/23, 12:27 PM - Christopher Ginting: a curl has changing angles
4/29/23, 12:27 PM - Christopher Ginting: i think thats some calculus shit right there
4/29/23, 12:28 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I hate Howard
4/29/23, 12:28 PM - Christopher Ginting: i love howard
4/29/23, 12:28 PM - Christopher Ginting: mad respect
4/29/23, 12:28 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Same but still
4/29/23, 12:28 PM - Christopher Ginting: i love him for making you hate him ❤️
4/29/23, 12:28 PM - Angry Board Gamer: So rude
4/29/23, 12:29 PM - Christopher Ginting: well i
4/29/23, 12:29 PM - Christopher Ginting: will try to work on it
4/29/23, 12:29 PM - Christopher Ginting: i will work with jason on this
4/29/23, 12:29 PM - Christopher Ginting: you'll see 😡
4/29/23, 12:29 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I have to do chemistry and now I must do this ADJDJSKS
4/29/23, 12:30 PM - Christopher Ginting: may some cows come zooming in large herds chewing some grass
4/29/23, 12:37 PM - Christopher Ginting: shit i messed that one up
4/29/23, 12:37 PM - Christopher Ginting: whatever
4/29/23, 1:33 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Haha you’ll get it eventually
4/29/23, 4:02 PM - Christopher Ginting: <Media omitted>
4/29/23, 4:02 PM - Angry Board Gamer: whoa looks fun!!
4/29/23, 4:03 PM - Angry Board Gamer: <Media omitted>
4/29/23, 4:03 PM - Angry Board Gamer: So I’m proud that at least one of us is touching grass
4/29/23, 4:03 PM - Christopher Ginting: You actually physically go to the library ??
4/29/23, 4:03 PM - Christopher Ginting: What does the library have that hoke doesnt
4/29/23, 4:03 PM - Christopher Ginting: Home
4/29/23, 4:03 PM - Angry Board Gamer: It’s what the library doesn’t have
4/29/23, 4:03 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Birds
4/29/23, 4:04 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Annoying ones
4/29/23, 4:04 PM - Christopher Ginting: Lmao imagineee
4/29/23, 4:04 PM - Christopher Ginting: Actually that's good right
4/29/23, 4:04 PM - Christopher Ginting: For a swimmer
4/29/23, 4:04 PM - Christopher Ginting: Cos like you gotta wake up early
4/29/23, 4:04 PM - Christopher Ginting: Wait no
4/29/23, 4:04 PM - Christopher Ginting: They chirp later
4/29/23, 4:04 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Yeah :(
4/29/23, 4:04 PM - Angry Board Gamer: It’s more like screaming
4/29/23, 4:04 PM - Christopher Ginting: They just chirp at bad times💀💀💀
4/29/23, 4:04 PM - Christopher Ginting: True
4/29/23, 4:04 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Yeahh
4/29/23, 4:04 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Like sunset and sunrise
4/29/23, 4:05 PM - Angry Board Gamer: They go crazy I don’t know what our neighbours think
4/29/23, 4:05 PM - Christopher Ginting: <Media omitted>
4/29/23, 4:05 PM - Christopher Ginting: Lmao
4/29/23, 4:05 PM - Christopher Ginting: I live on a fairly high floor
4/29/23, 4:05 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Whoa that looks so nice
4/29/23, 4:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: You know the first time I went to Singapore
4/29/23, 4:06 PM - Angry Board Gamer: That’s crazy thoufh I’ve been in boat houses before but they’re still weird to me
4/29/23, 4:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: I stayed in yotel
4/29/23, 4:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: ACTUALLY??
4/29/23, 4:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: Dayum
4/29/23, 4:06 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Like once
4/29/23, 4:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: And the room was smaller than the bedroom ong
4/29/23, 4:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: Like me alone
4/29/23, 4:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: Just basically a capsule
4/29/23, 4:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: In the Netherlands?
4/29/23, 4:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: Where
4/29/23, 4:06 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Singapore
4/29/23, 4:07 PM - Christopher Ginting: Wait they have boat houses here??
4/29/23, 4:07 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Yeahh it was my brother’s friend’s
4/29/23, 4:07 PM - Angry Board Gamer: But they lived there permanently
4/29/23, 4:08 PM - Angry Board Gamer: And my mom has a friend who lives in one too it’s so cool
4/29/23, 4:08 PM - Christopher Ginting: I thought that going to see yachts was cool
4/29/23, 4:08 PM - Christopher Ginting: But what's cooler is the fact that you can study like that
4/29/23, 4:08 PM - Christopher Ginting: I have as long an attention span as a goldfish memory
4/29/23, 4:08 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Like in a boat house?
4/29/23, 4:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: What do you mean
4/29/23, 4:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: In the library
4/29/23, 4:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: Sorry that wasn't clear
4/29/23, 4:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Going to see yachts is cool it’s like the ultimate experience
4/29/23, 4:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Haha np
4/29/23, 4:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: It’s so much easier
4/29/23, 4:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: You should come sometime you’ll see
4/29/23, 4:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: Scott's dad is like the alpha male business investor ngl everyone wants him so his son gets free everything
4/29/23, 4:10 PM - Christopher Ginting: Sure where
4/29/23, 4:10 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Bugis library
4/29/23, 4:10 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Just lmk if you’re going and I’ll go too
4/29/23, 4:10 PM - Angry Board Gamer: But in the afternoon it gets really crowded
4/29/23, 4:11 PM - Christopher Ginting: Wait afk
4/29/23, 4:11 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Afk??
4/29/23, 4:12 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Sorry I’m a little stupid
4/29/23, 4:12 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Ohh gotcha had to google
4/29/23, 4:12 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Still don’t entirely know what you mean
4/29/23, 4:12 PM - Angry Board Gamer: But yes I think so
4/29/23, 4:14 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Ohh you’re afk I get it
4/29/23, 4:23 PM - Christopher Ginting: So wait
4/29/23, 4:24 PM - Christopher Ginting: Let me get this straight
4/29/23, 4:24 PM - Christopher Ginting: You just go to the library
4/29/23, 4:24 PM - Christopher Ginting: In the morning
4/29/23, 4:24 PM - Christopher Ginting: And chill there and study
4/29/23, 4:24 PM - Christopher Ginting: That's so cool
4/29/23, 4:24 PM - Christopher Ginting: I actually admire people who can do that
4/29/23, 4:42 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Omg the most embarrassing thing just happened I told Molly she could charge her stuff where I’m sitting and she came over to get her iPad just as I was doodling the word salt ahaha
4/29/23, 4:42 PM - Angry Board Gamer: <Media omitted>
4/29/23, 4:43 PM - Angry Board Gamer: It looks so cool thoufh
4/29/23, 4:43 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Affirmative 👍
4/29/23, 4:43 PM - Angry Board Gamer: It’s kind of fun
4/29/23, 4:43 PM - Christopher Ginting: AAAAA WHAT STICK HANYU💀💀💀
4/29/23, 4:44 PM - Angry Board Gamer: WHATTT
4/29/23, 4:44 PM - Christopher Ginting: Nah
4/29/23, 4:44 PM - Angry Board Gamer: go away
4/29/23, 4:44 PM - Angry Board Gamer: It could be like a sticker or something
4/29/23, 4:44 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I’m so bored ugh
4/29/23, 4:44 PM - Christopher Ginting: Idk he played ng5 its a bad move but not the end of the world
4/29/23, 4:45 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Nonono can he still win??
4/29/23, 4:45 PM - Christopher Ginting: Yeah I think
4/29/23, 4:45 PM - Christopher Ginting: Maybe
4/29/23, 4:45 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Okk that’s good 🤞
4/29/23, 4:45 PM - Christopher Ginting: You still in library?
4/29/23, 4:45 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Yup
4/29/23, 4:46 PM - Christopher Ginting: Till when
4/29/23, 4:46 PM - Angry Board Gamer: <Media omitted>
4/29/23, 4:46 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Maybe an hour or so
4/29/23, 4:46 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Until I finish chem
4/29/23, 4:46 PM - Christopher Ginting: Aight
4/29/23, 4:46 PM - Christopher Ginting: I got the right acronym finally
4/29/23, 4:46 PM - Christopher Ginting: R u proud of me
4/29/23, 4:46 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Incredibly
4/29/23, 4:47 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Are you coming to the library now?
4/29/23, 4:47 PM - Christopher Ginting: I'm gonna ace chemistry fr
4/29/23, 4:47 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Yuhh 💪💪
4/29/23, 4:48 PM - Christopher Ginting: Afk agn brb
4/29/23, 4:48 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Yay I understood that I’m so proud of myself
4/29/23, 4:49 PM - Christopher Ginting: Yayy I'm so proud of you
4/29/23, 6:07 PM - Angry Board Gamer: <Media omitted>
4/29/23, 6:07 PM - Angry Board Gamer: HAHAHAHA
4/29/23, 6:07 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I WIN
4/29/23, 6:07 PM - Angry Board Gamer: YOU LOSE
4/29/23, 6:07 PM - Angry Board Gamer: AND I KNOW HE SAID POTENTIAL ENERGY BUT
4/29/23, 6:08 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I USED THE SAME EQUATION SO IM RIGHT
4/29/23, 7:42 PM - Christopher Ginting: i genuinely still believe that im right
4/29/23, 7:42 PM - Christopher Ginting: like this isnt a rope pulley fulcrum
4/29/23, 7:42 PM - Christopher Ginting: the force exerted by the bicep onto a forearm is perpendicular to the forearm right
4/29/23, 7:42 PM - Christopher Ginting: like think about it this way
4/29/23, 7:43 PM - Christopher Ginting: put your forearm at 90° (parallel to the ground) and at 45° (upwards)
4/29/23, 7:43 PM - Christopher Ginting: then curl 45° exactly
4/29/23, 7:43 PM - Christopher Ginting: which one is more difficult?
4/29/23, 7:45 PM - Christopher Ginting: katya please i hate being wrong 🥺
4/29/23, 7:46 PM - Christopher Ginting: at least have an actual argument with me about it
4/29/23, 7:51 PM - Christopher Ginting: 🥺
4/29/23, 7:53 PM - Christopher Ginting: also i want howards number 😡 this has got me riled up
4/29/23, 7:53 PM - Christopher Ginting: jk
4/29/23, 7:56 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Okk I see what you mean
4/29/23, 7:56 PM - Angry Board Gamer: But I’m still right
4/29/23, 7:57 PM - Christopher Ginting: Nice argument 👍
4/29/23, 7:57 PM - Christopher Ginting: Sure fine
4/29/23, 7:57 PM - Christopher Ginting: I give up ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
4/29/23, 7:57 PM - Christopher Ginting: hhhh
4/29/23, 7:57 PM - Christopher Ginting: hhhhhhhhhhhhhh
4/29/23, 7:57 PM - Christopher Ginting: I'll try calculate it my way when I start revising for admaths or physics 💢
4/29/23, 7:58 PM - Christopher Ginting: also sexy table i love this guy
4/29/23, 7:58 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Wait wait I’m back sorry had to clear the table
4/29/23, 7:58 PM - Christopher Ginting: oh darn no worries then
4/29/23, 7:59 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Ok so I see why you’re right but somehow I feel like my way works better
4/29/23, 7:59 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Just cause
4/29/23, 7:59 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Maybe I’m biased
4/29/23, 7:59 PM - Christopher Ginting: I think both of your guys' approaches work if you are lifting a dumbell
4/29/23, 7:59 PM - Christopher Ginting: but not with curls imo
4/29/23, 7:59 PM - Christopher Ginting: Cos literally
4/29/23, 7:59 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Wait I’ll get a dumbbell gimme one minute
4/29/23, 7:59 PM - Christopher Ginting: trace the path of a curled dumbbell
4/29/23, 7:59 PM - Christopher Ginting: its not a straight line
4/29/23, 8:00 PM - Christopher Ginting: so simply having a straight line distance doesnt make sense
4/29/23, 8:00 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Fine then it’s 0.5pi * 1/4
4/29/23, 8:00 PM - Christopher Ginting: thats what i thought too but
4/29/23, 8:00 PM - Christopher Ginting: this
4/29/23, 8:01 PM - Christopher Ginting: i was waving my arm like an idiot
4/29/23, 8:01 PM - Christopher Ginting: in front of my parent ok
4/29/23, 8:01 PM - Christopher Ginting: trying to ork this out
4/29/23, 8:01 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Wait doesn’t it just average out
4/29/23, 8:01 PM - Christopher Ginting: how do you know that?
4/29/23, 8:01 PM - Angry Board Gamer: <Media omitted>
4/29/23, 8:01 PM - Christopher Ginting: okay
4/29/23, 8:02 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Ok so
4/29/23, 8:02 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I think it’s just 37.5 because it’s the energy needed which is going to be the same no matter how hard it is
4/29/23, 8:02 PM - Angry Board Gamer: If that makes sense
4/29/23, 8:02 PM - Christopher Ginting: what
4/29/23, 8:03 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Because it feeling difficult doesn’t make it use more energy in a physics sense
4/29/23, 8:03 PM - Christopher Ginting: it uses more force
4/29/23, 8:03 PM - Christopher Ginting: thats what it means
4/29/23, 8:03 PM - Angry Board Gamer: It just means you’re not strong enough
4/29/23, 8:03 PM - Christopher Ginting: damn got me
4/29/23, 8:03 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Isn’t it just that you aren’t able to put that much force in?
4/29/23, 8:03 PM - Christopher Ginting: force is a component of energy here
4/29/23, 8:03 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I’m not 100% sure though
4/29/23, 8:04 PM - Christopher Ginting: your biceps are always the same strength????
4/29/23, 8:04 PM - Christopher Ginting: what could be holding it back
4/29/23, 8:04 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Nono like you’ll always need to put the same energy in
4/29/23, 8:04 PM - Angry Board Gamer: It feeling difficult is your body not being able to put the energy in
4/29/23, 8:04 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Doesn’t mean it needs less energy
4/29/23, 8:04 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Because imagine it’s just a piece of wood that is mechanically lifted
4/29/23, 8:04 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Not an arm
4/29/23, 8:05 PM - Christopher Ginting: okay
4/29/23, 8:05 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Doesn’t that just make it the same force needed
4/29/23, 8:05 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Ok for example
4/29/23, 8:05 PM - Angry Board Gamer: If I need to lift a 5000kg weight I need to apply a force of 50000N which I can’t do
4/29/23, 8:05 PM - Angry Board Gamer: But someone else
4/29/23, 8:05 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Who’s ridiculously strong might be able to
4/29/23, 8:05 PM - Angry Board Gamer: But we both have to use the same force
4/29/23, 8:06 PM - Angry Board Gamer: And so if you use the equation it ends up being the same
4/29/23, 8:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: theres gravity if your force is less than acceleration it doesnt work
4/29/23, 8:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: you need to subtract and shit
4/29/23, 8:06 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Wait what do you mean
4/29/23, 8:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: force vectors ✨
4/29/23, 8:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: ok uhm
4/29/23, 8:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: crap drawing time
4/29/23, 8:06 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Yay my favourite
4/29/23, 8:07 PM - Christopher Ginting: ok so never mind but i think i can explain it in words
4/29/23, 8:08 PM - Christopher Ginting: so remember those force diagrams of cars
4/29/23, 8:08 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Yeah
4/29/23, 8:08 PM - Christopher Ginting: the reason you can't lift it is because you are exerting less force than gravity
4/29/23, 8:08 PM - Christopher Ginting: and so there is net downwards
4/29/23, 8:08 PM - Christopher Ginting: stronger people have more force
4/29/23, 8:08 PM - Christopher Ginting: net force up
4/29/23, 8:08 PM - Christopher Ginting: lift 👍
4/29/23, 8:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: But the force we need to exert is the same
4/29/23, 8:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: right?? or am i dumb i think im dumb
4/29/23, 8:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Nono i get what you mean
4/29/23, 8:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I’m so confused now
4/29/23, 8:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: Ok I will collate my argument when I have the time i need to case study niger's population growth though
4/29/23, 8:10 PM - Angry Board Gamer: 👍
4/29/23, 8:15 PM - Christopher Ginting: well seems like a website's done my work
4/29/23, 8:15 PM - Christopher Ginting: https://courses.lumenlearning.com/atd-austincc-physics1/chapter/9-6-forces-and-torques-in-muscles-and-joints/
4/29/23, 8:15 PM - Christopher Ginting: It involves torque and angle calculations and not simple distance*force
4/29/23, 8:18 PM - Christopher Ginting: Oh wait there's a bunch of stuff in there that is not in the question
4/29/23, 8:18 PM - Christopher Ginting: so you guys might be wrong but I'm wrong too
4/29/23, 8:26 PM - Christopher Ginting: OKMKATYA
4/29/23, 8:26 PM - Christopher Ginting: I FOUND IT
4/29/23, 8:26 PM - Christopher Ginting: https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/rocket/torque.html#:~:text=The%20product%20of%20the%20force,the%20torque%20or%20the%20moment.
4/29/23, 8:27 PM - Christopher Ginting: This is torque against gravity
4/29/23, 8:27 PM - Christopher Ginting: Typically torque ('energy used') is force times length which the article acknowledges BUT trigonometry must be used for any angles not 90 or 0 relative to the ground
4/29/23, 8:28 PM - Christopher Ginting: I feel so good being right 😌 take that liberalss] ben shapiro walter hartwell ehite
4/29/23, 8:29 PM - Christopher Ginting: aight study time fr
4/29/23, 8:29 PM - Christopher Ginting: <Media omitted>
4/29/23, 8:30 PM - Christopher Ginting: sorry for 14 messages 👻
4/29/23, 8:34 PM - Christopher Ginting: the reason i said calculus was because cosa is constantly changing so you need to add up infinitely many values so integration
4/29/23, 8:38 PM - Christopher Ginting: Because like, when you are curling a dumbbell then the amount of force constantly changes depending on the angle so you cant just multiply two values you gotta integrate with respect to the curve flcosa
4/29/23, 8:38 PM - Christopher Ginting: to find energy
4/29/23, 9:02 PM - Christopher Ginting: also regarding 'it's not moments it's potential energy' doing curls is not the most efficient method to convert potential energy because its not in a straight line
4/29/23, 9:03 PM - Christopher Ginting: convert to*
4/29/23, 9:33 PM - Christopher Ginting: katya i believe i am wrong but this has become an actual obsession of mine i will work this out with my mother who has a masters in mechanical engineering
4/29/23, 10:10 PM - Christopher Ginting: My dad and my mom are arguing over this problem what have you done
4/29/23, 10:10 PM - Christopher Ginting: My dad is on Howard's side for the reason of mgh=1/2mv^2
4/29/23, 10:11 PM - Christopher Ginting: My mom is on about this infinite torque sum nonsense
4/29/23, 10:12 PM - Christopher Ginting: I think the sum will converge to 37.5
4/29/23, 10:13 PM - Christopher Ginting: Katya katya katya my mom is awake past 11pm this is special
4/29/23, 10:27 PM - Christopher Ginting: I regret this they're not stopping
4/29/23, 10:28 PM - Christopher Ginting: I'm fairly sure my whole family has adhd or something
4/29/23, 10:57 PM - Angry Board Gamer: WHOA that’s awesome
4/29/23, 10:57 PM - Angry Board Gamer: That’s so cool I’m going to have to read this article
4/29/23, 10:57 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Ok so I have to go to sleep now unfortunately but tomorrow morning I’m gonna read the hell out of that article
4/29/23, 10:58 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Should I involve my brother??? He’s also an engineering nerd ahaha
4/29/23, 11:03 PM - Angry Board Gamer: <Media omitted>
4/29/23, 11:04 PM - Angry Board Gamer: NOO I love it this is so entertaining
4/29/23, 11:05 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Ok so I’m pretty sure that I’m wrong about the moments thing but using mgh makes sense but so does your complicated thingy
4/29/23, 11:06 PM - Angry Board Gamer: ITS SPREADING
4/30/23, 2:32 AM - Christopher Ginting: YOU SAID LIFT
4/30/23, 2:32 AM - Christopher Ginting: NOT CURL
4/30/23, 2:32 AM - Christopher Ginting: IDIOT😡😡
4/30/23, 2:33 AM - Christopher Ginting: KATYA THATS DIFFERENT
4/30/23, 2:44 AM - Christopher Ginting: This is also like sorta with two asterisks my point
4/30/23, 6:12 AM - Angry Board Gamer: I CHABFED IT YOU XANT SEE XSUSE JTS LATER
4/30/23, 6:12 AM - Angry Board Gamer: BUT I DID
4/30/23, 6:12 AM - Angry Board Gamer: I WAS TIRED OKKK
4/30/23, 6:15 AM - Angry Board Gamer: Okk but I still feel like I can make them equal each other because I did the exact same thing as if I had done mgh ugh I don’t even know anymore
4/30/23, 7:31 AM - Christopher Ginting: I am actually cycling through the 7 stages of grief
4/30/23, 7:31 AM - Christopher Ginting: I'm nearing acceptance now
4/30/23, 7:31 AM - Christopher Ginting: but i don't have a concrete answer or why
4/30/23, 8:18 AM - Angry Board Gamer: No but same and i don’t even know if I’m wrong
4/30/23, 4:04 PM - Christopher Ginting: I've given up
4/30/23, 4:04 PM - Christopher Ginting: Also if you are worried about your secret because of what's going on with olivier I can assure you that I have not said a word about it honest to god
4/30/23, 4:10 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Hahaha yeah no worries I believe you
4/30/23, 7:04 PM - Christopher Ginting: stick hanyu is on his last game
5/1/23, 4:05 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Did he win? I’m scared now
5/1/23, 4:06 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Sorry would have texted more but she was sitting RIGHT NEXT TO ME
5/1/23, 4:06 PM - Angry Board Gamer: But anyways I don’t think I like her that way anymore ahaha
5/1/23, 4:08 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Just get like friend vibes from her if you what I mean not that anything happened it’s just the conversations we have I would NOT have with someone I was crushing on
5/1/23, 5:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: Would you really
5/1/23, 5:08 PM - Angry Board Gamer: What do you mean?
5/1/23, 5:10 PM - Christopher Ginting: Well I used to think that I my conversations with my last crush would be super cool and casual and everything but I overshared to hell and back and she kinda did too but tbf I overshare alot just not as much as you💀💀
5/1/23, 5:11 PM - Christopher Ginting: Wdym something I would talk to with my crush
5/1/23, 5:11 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Like it’s more of things I wouldn’t talk to my crush about yk??
5/1/23, 5:11 PM - Christopher Ginting: Like actual friend stuff
5/1/23, 5:11 PM - Christopher Ginting: Like the new rainbow 6 game
5/1/23, 5:11 PM - Christopher Ginting: Cos I definitely talked about that with her
5/1/23, 5:12 PM - Angry Board Gamer: No more like who we think is rlly attractive shit like that etc etc
5/1/23, 5:12 PM - Angry Board Gamer: More etcs
5/1/23, 5:12 PM - Angry Board Gamer: So not really like crush kinda stuff
5/1/23, 5:12 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Aww that’s cute
5/1/23, 5:12 PM - Christopher Ginting: Ohhhh
5/1/23, 5:13 PM - Christopher Ginting: Well I guess that's your call
5/1/23, 5:13 PM - Angry Board Gamer: And it wasn’t weird or anything yk it was just like gossiping and shit
5/1/23, 5:13 PM - Angry Board Gamer: So it was really just more of friend vibes
5/1/23, 5:13 PM - Christopher Ginting: Maybe she's tryna get you to think about attraction in general (she's right next to you💀)
5/1/23, 5:13 PM - Christopher Ginting: Nah jk ur interpretation
5/1/23, 5:14 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Hahaha no definitely not
5/1/23, 5:14 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Just thought I would update you
5/1/23, 5:14 PM - Angry Board Gamer: That my little freak out is over :)

5/1/23, 5:19 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Shut up
5/1/23, 5:20 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Most accurate thing I’ve ever heard
5/1/23, 5:20 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Also the number of ppl who think I’m naive or innocent is so funny to me
5/1/23, 5:20 PM - Christopher Ginting: Like ace econs but probably can't comprehend the DVD screen saver
5/1/23, 5:20 PM - Christopher Ginting: I'm not surprised
5/1/23, 5:20 PM - Angry Board Gamer: this is scaring me how do you know this about me
5/1/23, 5:21 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Also ace econs?? it’s nice someone has confidence
5/1/23, 5:21 PM - Christopher Ginting: Yeah chika from kaguyasan anime irl confirmed
5/1/23, 5:21 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I like that you’re chill as well like it’s so nice to have genuine conversations
5/1/23, 5:21 PM - Christopher Ginting: Do you wish to be a politician when you grow up ⁉️⁉️
5/1/23, 5:21 PM - Christopher Ginting: Do you not have conversations with other people💀💀
5/1/23, 5:21 PM - Christopher Ginting: But thanks
5/1/23, 5:21 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Nono like I do but you’re just nice to talk to
5/1/23, 5:22 PM - Christopher Ginting: YOU WNA BE A POLITICIALN??
5/1/23, 5:22 PM - Angry Board Gamer: UGH NOOO
5/1/23, 5:22 PM - Christopher Ginting: I'm telling hanyu this
5/1/23, 5:22 PM - Christopher Ginting: Ohhhhhh noooooo
5/1/23, 5:22 PM - Angry Board Gamer: GO AWAYY
5/1/23, 5:22 PM - Christopher Ginting: Hanyu would be so happy to know ur analog to chika

5/1/23, 5:23 PM - Christopher Ginting: ...
5/1/23, 5:23 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Kidding kidding your nerd things are fun
5/1/23, 5:23 PM - Christopher Ginting: Go say little nerd things to hanyu😭
5/1/23, 5:23 PM - Christopher Ginting: He'd be more.pissed than me
5/1/23, 5:23 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Probs will
5/1/23, 5:24 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Or already have
5/1/23, 5:24 PM - Christopher Ginting: Yeah he calls people normiee
5/1/23, 5:24 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Also I’m so sorry but I’ve got to go now byee
5/1/23, 5:24 PM - Christopher Ginting: But that's funny
5/1/23, 5:24 PM - Christopher Ginting: Aight bye
5/3/23, 6:28 AM - Christopher Ginting: Katya
5/3/23, 6:28 AM - Christopher Ginting: I drank coffee today
5/3/23, 6:28 AM - Christopher Ginting: Probably too much
5/3/23, 6:28 AM - Christopher Ginting: I feel so shit
5/3/23, 6:28 AM - Christopher Ginting: I can't do geo like this
5/3/23, 8:26 AM - Angry Board Gamer: Oh noo
5/3/23, 8:26 AM - Angry Board Gamer: I hope you feel better :((
5/3/23, 8:26 AM - Angry Board Gamer: I know too much coffee makes me anxious
5/3/23, 8:27 AM - Angry Board Gamer: But just relax and have some water or something and it’ll wear off
5/3/23, 9:13 AM - Christopher Ginting: It did eventually
5/3/23, 7:32 PM - Christopher Ginting: Katya I posted this on the group chat but I'll elaborate further
5/3/23, 7:32 PM - Christopher Ginting: During the science p4 there was an apparent problem with the booklet being sticky, so turning the page would turn two pages instead of one
5/3/23, 7:33 PM - Christopher Ginting: Raunak noticed this and asked people on a group chat I'm on and some people couldn't remember answering some of the questions
5/3/23, 7:34 PM - Christopher Ginting: Maybe they just don't remember but there's a solid chance that the sticky booklet caused some people to skip questions
5/3/23, 7:34 PM - Christopher Ginting: seeing that this is a REOCCURING issue you need to approach the school or exam board IMMEDIATELY and complain to hell and back
5/3/23, 7:34 PM - Christopher Ginting: Don't go down without a fight ✊
5/3/23, 7:35 PM - Christopher Ginting: Hope this helps I guess
5/3/23, 7:51 PM - Christopher Ginting: Or you could resit in november like you said I didn't even realise that was a thing
5/4/23, 7:25 AM - Angry Board Gamer: Thanks Chris that’s really sweet of you to say but unfortunately this was my fault haha
5/4/23, 7:26 AM - Angry Board Gamer: I thought it was the last question for some reason and didn’t flip through to the end
5/4/23, 7:26 AM - Angry Board Gamer: And then I went to sleep because I was so exhausted instead of checking through my paper so it was definitely my fault
5/4/23, 8:15 AM - Christopher Ginting: Well then you should get more sleep before tests💀💀💀
5/4/23, 8:25 AM - Angry Board Gamer: No I literally slept so eaely the night before like I missed dinner because I couldn’t stay awake so idk what happened
5/4/23, 8:26 AM - Angry Board Gamer: I talked to my English teacher she was really nice she gave me candy
5/4/23, 10:24 AM - Christopher Ginting: Aw that's sweet
5/4/23, 10:24 AM - Christopher Ginting: In both ways now I think about it
5/4/23, 4:51 PM - Angry Board Gamer: <Media omitted>
5/4/23, 4:51 PM - Angry Board Gamer: The comments are so funny
5/4/23, 4:52 PM - Angry Board Gamer: <Media omitted>
5/4/23, 4:52 PM - Angry Board Gamer: <Media omitted>
5/4/23, 4:53 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Wow chess people are nerds I didn’t know it was possible to be this nerdy
5/4/23, 4:53 PM - Angry Board Gamer: It’s cute though
5/4/23, 5:33 PM - Angry Board Gamer: CHRIS CHRIS CHRIS DID YOU KNOW HE WON
5/4/23, 5:33 PM - Angry Board Gamer: ARRIYAN TOLD ME WHY HAVENT YOU UPDATED ME YET
5/4/23, 5:34 PM - Angry Board Gamer: AND APPARENTLY IT WAS A REALLY TOUGH MATCH
5/4/23, 5:34 PM - Angry Board Gamer: AKDJWODHAOAJ
5/4/23, 5:34 PM - Angry Board Gamer: HE WON CHESS
5/4/23, 7:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: Well you asked if he won and then you started talking about your potential crush and I thought it would be inappropriate to butt in with him winning
5/4/23, 7:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: Rg6 was epic gamer though😡😡
5/4/23, 7:07 PM - Angry Board Gamer: NO I DONT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ABY POTENTIAL CRUSHES I MAY HAVE THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT 😡😡
5/4/23, 7:07 PM - Angry Board Gamer: LOVE IS TEMPORARY
5/4/23, 7:07 PM - Angry Board Gamer: CHESS IS FOREVER
5/4/23, 7:07 PM - Christopher Ginting: I feel so
5/4/23, 7:07 PM - Christopher Ginting: so
5/4/23, 7:07 PM - Christopher Ginting: accomplished
5/4/23, 7:07 PM - Angry Board Gamer: In chess??

5/4/23, 7:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: You'll get that reference sometime no worries
5/4/23, 7:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Hehe was about to google
5/4/23, 7:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I’m waiting
5/4/23, 7:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: Paul Morphy is the proprietor of the "romantic" school of chess
5/4/23, 7:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Ahh gotcha
5/4/23, 7:10 PM - Christopher Ginting: Yeah that's so lame😭
5/4/23, 7:10 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Noo it would have been funny if I knew jackshit about chess
5/4/23, 7:10 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Unfortunately I do not
5/4/23, 7:10 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I mean at least you’re self aware
5/4/23, 7:11 PM - Christopher Ginting: I can be self aware but you weren't supposed to acknowledge😡😡😡😡
5/4/23, 7:11 PM - Christopher Ginting: My ego is gone
5/4/23, 7:11 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Too bad I’m just intuitive that way
5/4/23, 7:11 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Good
5/4/23, 7:11 PM - Christopher Ginting: Oh shit terminator katya has arrived
5/4/23, 7:11 PM - Christopher Ginting: Absolutely ruthless

5/4/23, 7:13 PM - Christopher Ginting: Ok so I was gonna make a dick joke but then I realized that your sexuality is a bit uncertain so I held that thought💀💀
5/4/23, 7:13 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Hehe make it anyways I’m still gonna find it funny
5/4/23, 7:13 PM - Angry Board Gamer: And I do like guys
5/4/23, 7:13 PM - Angry Board Gamer: That’s not the confusing part

5/11/23, 9:23 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Heyy just wanted to let you know that if you want to send your paragraph privately if in a gc is kinda intimidating that’s ok, no pressure or anything but I’m here if you want
5/11/23, 9:24 PM - Angry Board Gamer: But you totally don’t have to so pls pls pls don’t if you don’t want to
5/11/23, 9:24 PM - Christopher Ginting: Gotcha
5/11/23, 9:24 PM - Christopher Ginting: It'd be wrong to not tolerate them. I will structure this message with lettered points:
a) listening to them and choosing to associate with them is something different
b) they're actually really funny people (HOLD UP LISTEN TO ME)
c) in 2012 John Koenig wrote _The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows_, which is a list of new words for emotions that lack words. He coined the word 'sonder' which went viral on insta a while back I think. In the context of Philip and Amartya, both of them perceive humour in a way that WE cannot understand, and same for them to us (we probably look like emo reddit edgelords or something) and their perception is the amalgamation of everything that has ever happened to them INCLUDING their upbringing and to not tolerate them is a blatant act of neglect and reductionism that amounts their views as being nil. So what they're doing IS funny and not dumb just not to us and these negative externalities (economics 🤓) that they inflict on us is actually just kinda us not liking their humour like what have they actually done? Have they made fun of us? Have they kicked us? On Amartya's side I can say with a 99% certainty that no he isn't and it's just kinda mean that he's inherently bad for following his own beliefs and stuff aaaaaaaaaa what is this rant I read Laforgueian philosophy once and I think it's destroyed my brain wtf
5/11/23, 9:24 PM - Christopher Ginting: it makes no sense
5/11/23, 9:24 PM - Christopher Ginting: its incoherent
5/11/23, 9:25 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Shut up for a second I’m reading
5/11/23, 9:25 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Yeah tbh they’re honestly so funny but not in a wow you’re really witty way but more of a like wtf way yk??
5/11/23, 9:26 PM - Christopher Ginting: they're witty funny to each other
5/11/23, 9:26 PM - Christopher Ginting: my point condensed
5/11/23, 9:26 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I just get pissed off if they’re rude to ms Campbell otherwise they can do whatever they want
5/11/23, 9:26 PM - Christopher Ginting: that's true
5/11/23, 9:26 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Like I have issues with tony because of shit like that

5/11/23, 9:27 PM - Christopher Ginting: its all about perspective in the end
5/11/23, 9:27 PM - Christopher Ginting: what i wrote doesn't make sense in that light
5/11/23, 9:27 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Nothing he’s done in my classes but yeah other stuff my friends have told me is fucked up so I just don’t interact with him
5/11/23, 9:28 PM - Christopher Ginting: he humps guys without their permission
5/11/23, 9:28 PM - Angry Board Gamer: But Philip and amartyadon’t really do anything like that so I’m cool with them ig
5/11/23, 9:28 PM - Christopher Ginting: under the pretesne that he's 'gay'
5/11/23, 9:29 PM - Christopher Ginting: also he's kinda racist?
5/11/23, 9:29 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Yeahh and like Sara was telling me he told this one girl in her class she’s rlly pretty and guys would ask her for handjobs so she should learn and he demonstrated on her water bottle not trying to gossip or anything but I don’t really give a fuck if tony gets offended by this
5/11/23, 9:29 PM - Angry Board Gamer: So yeah
5/11/23, 9:29 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Really dislike him

5/27/23, 10:37 AM - Christopher Ginting: As in which exam was awful? French?
5/27/23, 10:37 AM - Christopher Ginting: Same but it was more me being really underconfident in myself and I initially drew the graph too small
5/27/23, 10:37 AM - Christopher Ginting: So I redraw it again
5/27/23, 10:38 AM - Christopher Ginting: But then the demand curves were too close
5/27/23, 10:38 AM - Christopher Ginting: So then I redraw it again
5/27/23, 10:38 AM - Christopher Ginting: You get the point

6/4/23, 10:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: Sorry for slow typing though

6/4/23, 10:07 PM - Christopher Ginting: Ok so it's called Boys Abyss
6/4/23, 10:07 PM - Christopher Ginting: It's another comic (I don't have the concentration to read books 🫡)
6/4/23, 10:08 PM - Christopher Ginting: So there's a boy who falls in love with an idol
6/4/23, 10:08 PM - Christopher Ginting: It's a hopeless love right cos no way the idol sees him
6/4/23, 10:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: But this kid is roaming around
6/4/23, 10:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: And he SEES HER
6/4/23, 10:10 PM - Christopher Ginting: In fact actually she beckons him over
6/4/23, 10:10 PM - Christopher Ginting: And she seduces him
6/4/23, 10:11 PM - Christopher Ginting: They have sex
6/4/23, 10:11 PM - Christopher Ginting: And this kid can't believe it (he's a high school student now to be clear)
6/4/23, 10:12 PM - Christopher Ginting: Wait ima shower rq
6/4/23, 10:31 PM - Christopher Ginting: Ok I chill in bed it's all good now
6/4/23, 10:31 PM - Christopher Ginting: So this idol that he just had sex with is really weird
6/4/23, 10:31 PM - Christopher Ginting: She says
6/4/23, 10:31 PM - Christopher Ginting: I want you to jump off this famous bridge with me
6/4/23, 10:31 PM - Christopher Ginting: And we both kill ourselves
6/4/23, 10:32 PM - Christopher Ginting: So he's like aight
6/4/23, 10:32 PM - Christopher Ginting: So they go to the bridge and she says that he has to go first
6/4/23, 10:32 PM - Christopher Ginting: I don't remember exactly what happened exactly but he ends up escaping somehow
6/4/23, 10:33 PM - Christopher Ginting: And he's like I'm NEVER going back (spoiler: he goes back)
6/4/23, 10:34 PM - Christopher Ginting: This kid is one of those types of people that think they will never have a girlfriend but it turns out that he has a female childhood friend
6/4/23, 10:34 PM - Christopher Ginting: Her nickname is Chako. It means something like a mochi sweet in japanese
6/4/23, 10:34 PM - Christopher Ginting: That's because she's pretty chubby
6/4/23, 10:35 PM - Christopher Ginting: I used to have stickers of her but I changed phones a while back. She's pretty cute actually
6/4/23, 10:35 PM - Christopher Ginting: Chako likes the kid and tries to you know be with him
6/4/23, 10:36 PM - Christopher Ginting: But this kid is battling his thoughts regarding what the fuck just happened
6/4/23, 10:36 PM - Christopher Ginting: Also his mom is abusive
6/4/23, 10:36 PM - Christopher Ginting: So he runs to his classroom teacher
6/4/23, 10:36 PM - Christopher Ginting: She seduces him and they have sex
6/4/23, 10:37 PM - Christopher Ginting: Now the teacher becomes crazy and tries to take him away from his parents asap
6/4/23, 10:37 PM - Christopher Ginting: And make him her sex slave or something
6/4/23, 10:43 PM - Christopher Ginting: Shiet I'm in bed now idk if I should continue writing
6/4/23, 10:43 PM - Christopher Ginting: I'll do it tomorrow when you're there for it
6/4/23, 10:43 PM - Christopher Ginting: Good night 🫡🫡
6/5/23, 7:07 AM - Angry Board Gamer: Chris I’m back what happens next I must know
6/5/23, 8:28 AM - Angry Board Gamer: Are you at school yet
6/5/23, 8:28 AM - Angry Board Gamer: Christopher
6/5/23, 8:28 AM - Angry Board Gamer: Stop ignoring me
6/5/23, 9:02 AM - Christopher Ginting: I literally wasn't awake yet when you sent those messages
6/5/23, 9:03 AM - Christopher Ginting: Oook I'm so sorry 🥹
6/5/23, 9:04 AM - Christopher Ginting: So he goes back to Chakos place (his lovers place)
6/5/23, 9:04 AM - Christopher Ginting: And Chako is the most sweet and cute ball of human that he has ever seen
6/5/23, 9:04 AM - Christopher Ginting: But he doesn't love her
6/5/23, 9:05 AM - Christopher Ginting: Chako unlike the others doesn't try to seduce him, but instead gets ruthlessly friend zoned over and over again despite being, you know, a decent human being
6/5/23, 9:05 AM - Christopher Ginting: So she thinks it's her weight
6/5/23, 9:06 AM - Christopher Ginting: When the kid finally has the courage to get out and go back to his parents then she locks herself in her room and doesn't go out for the rest of the semester
6/5/23, 9:07 AM - Christopher Ginting: I'll give you a before and after
6/5/23, 9:07 AM - Christopher Ginting: <Media omitted>
6/5/23, 9:07 AM - Christopher Ginting: <Media omitted>
6/5/23, 9:07 AM - Christopher Ginting: She's also been very obviously mentally damaged after not going out of her room for ages
6/5/23, 9:08 AM - Christopher Ginting: But in a super cruel twist the kid NOW wants to have sex with her
6/5/23, 9:08 AM - Christopher Ginting: Also not to mention Chako's parents are Christian evangelist preacher assholes that believe in the sanctity and purity of mind or something
6/5/23, 9:09 AM - Christopher Ginting: But they ban anything so for example they once saw a gravure model book in her room and they physically abuses her for it
6/5/23, 9:10 AM - Christopher Ginting: Now here's where the story really begins (yeah its really long)
6/5/23, 9:10 AM - Christopher Ginting: Wait shit there are so many side stories I think I skipped over the main one
6/5/23, 9:11 AM - Christopher Ginting: Let's rewind back here
6/5/23, 9:11 AM - Christopher Ginting: Chako and the kid both have their idols
6/5/23, 9:11 AM - Christopher Ginting: For chako it's the one he lost his virginity to and for chako it's a famous novelist
6/5/23, 9:12 AM - Christopher Ginting: She looooooves books (I think the author wanted to make her super adorable and cute I think he succeeded 🥹)
6/5/23, 9:13 AM - Christopher Ginting: Literally soo innocent and kind I don't know how the kid doesn't fall in love with her after facing abuse. Probably the trauma
6/5/23, 9:13 AM - Christopher Ginting: So suddenly the kid gets a text from the idol but something strange also happens
6/5/23, 9:14 AM - Christopher Ginting: Chako gets a text from someone claiming to be HER author idol
6/5/23, 9:14 AM - Christopher Ginting: And so they're both like WHAAAAT THATS CRAZY IMA GO SEE HIM/HER RIGHT NOW
6/5/23, 9:14 AM - Christopher Ginting: That was a fucked up mistake 👍
6/5/23, 9:15 AM - Christopher Ginting: So they both go the next evening to see the people they admire so much
6/5/23, 9:16 AM - Christopher Ginting: Chako arrives first and it's the real deal
6/5/23, 9:16 AM - Christopher Ginting: But he's not the person she thinks he is
6/5/23, 9:17 AM - Christopher Ginting: He lives in this run down house that's beginning to rot, and he only eats instant noodles and natto
6/5/23, 9:17 AM - Christopher Ginting: She also sees this super beautiful woman next to him
6/5/23, 9:17 AM - Christopher Ginting: Like SUPER SUPER beautiful
6/5/23, 9:18 AM - Christopher Ginting: Intermission time I gotta eat something for breakfast at least👍
6/5/23, 9:53 AM - Christopher Ginting: Intermission over
6/5/23, 9:54 AM - Christopher Ginting: So chako is like huh that's weird but we're chill cos I don't like like my idol I just think he's a really good author right
6/5/23, 9:54 AM - Christopher Ginting: So they have a very wholesome conversation and she leaves
6/5/23, 9:57 AM - Christopher Ginting: Meanwhile the kid is taking an intentionally long route to the place he is supposed to go
6/5/23, 9:58 AM - Christopher Ginting: Because he's fairly certain that she's gonna try and kill him
6/5/23, 9:58 AM - Christopher Ginting: But he's like fuck it I'm gonna get seduced again
6/5/23, 9:59 AM - Christopher Ginting: So he goes there but really late
6/5/23, 10:00 AM - Christopher Ginting: He arrives at the run down house and with his idol is a really scruffy looking author
6/5/23, 10:00 AM - Christopher Ginting: (They're the same people that Chako met)
6/5/23, 10:04 AM - Christopher Ginting: And then the kid has sex with the idol again in front of the author
6/5/23, 10:06 AM - Christopher Ginting: Now this scene was so heartbreaking that it won an award in the kodainsha manga awards iirc
6/5/23, 10:07 AM - Christopher Ginting: Now I'm gonna fast forward to what I know because it's an ongoing series and if I keep describing this to you in the level of detail I'll be here till after the exams start
6/5/23, 10:07 AM - Christopher Ginting: Let's go back here
6/5/23, 10:08 AM - Christopher Ginting: Teacher is fucking crazy and tries to seduce and kidnap the kid
6/5/23, 10:08 AM - Christopher Ginting: Also mind you chako has lost her weight and her mind
6/5/23, 10:08 AM - Christopher Ginting: So now chako loses her virginity to the kids cousin cos he looks like him
6/5/23, 10:09 AM - Christopher Ginting: But now he repeatedly sexually assaults her
6/5/23, 10:11 AM - Christopher Ginting: Teacher reports to the authorities that parents are abusing the kid (they are but this is framed in a way where the teachers abuse is objectively worse)
6/5/23, 10:11 AM - Christopher Ginting: And she tries to take custody
6/5/23, 10:12 AM - Christopher Ginting: So she fakes a 'survey' where the parents put their signature. I'm sure you know how she's gonna use that signature
6/5/23, 10:12 AM - Christopher Ginting: And so it culminates in this panel which is so famous that it's associated with the entire manga
6/5/23, 10:12 AM - Christopher Ginting: Lemme find it
6/5/23, 10:13 AM - Christopher Ginting: <Media omitted>
6/5/23, 10:14 AM - Christopher Ginting: Also I notice how similar chako post transformation and the teacher look. Chako wants to look like the teacher because she gets the kid
6/5/23, 10:18 AM - Christopher Ginting: That's about where I am with the manga
6/5/23, 10:18 AM - Christopher Ginting: I skipped about 10 chapters of senseless abuse directed at chako
6/5/23, 10:18 AM - Christopher Ginting: But yeah I have about 20 more chapters left to read until I'm fully caught up
6/5/23, 10:18 AM - Christopher Ginting: So yeah🥹🥹👍

6/5/23, 8:26 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Wait that’s actually ridiculously impressive
6/5/23, 8:27 PM - Christopher Ginting: And our family on my moms side is an intense patriarchy so my grandpa has a lot of say
6/5/23, 8:27 PM - Christopher Ginting: So my grandpa is genuinely not proud of him despite his achievements reaching at least 100k people????
6/5/23, 8:27 PM - Christopher Ginting: And I feel so bad for him

6/5/23, 8:28 PM - Christopher Ginting: Including me
6/5/23, 8:28 PM - Christopher Ginting: Because like we're just scare of being unvalidated
6/5/23, 8:28 PM - Christopher Ginting: My cousin is the oldest of his grandchildren btw

6/5/23, 8:29 PM - Christopher Ginting: Gramps
6/5/23, 8:29 PM - Christopher Ginting: Grammaw is so chill though I love her
6/5/23, 8:30 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Like the thing for me is that my grandad is probably like that but he was quite awful with my mom when she just married my dad and so she will absolutely not take anything from him yk
6/5/23, 8:30 PM - Angry Board Gamer: The rest of my family is awful though
6/5/23, 8:30 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Like extended

6/5/23, 8:31 PM - Christopher Ginting: Damm yeah my grandpa's children really hate him actually
6/5/23, 8:31 PM - Christopher Ginting: But there's that intrinsic bias for some reason I feel
6/5/23, 8:31 PM - Christopher Ginting: Just like he's still really.important

6/23/23, 1:50 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Hahaha
6/23/23, 1:50 PM - Angry Board Gamer: She’s really nice though even though she said I was short
6/23/23, 1:51 PM - Angry Board Gamer: It’s cause her whole family is crazy tall

6/23/23, 1:54 PM - Christopher Ginting: So I think there's some weird reverse height thing going on
6/23/23, 2:39 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Hahaha you’re gonna start shrinking soon
6/23/23, 3:45 PM - Christopher Ginting: Noooooooo
6/23/23, 4:49 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Too bad it’s in your genes 🧬
6/23/23, 4:55 PM - Christopher Ginting: You can diss me but you can't diss my parents, sorry
6/23/23, 4:55 PM - Christopher Ginting: How dare you 😡
6/23/23, 4:55 PM - Christopher Ginting: Jk
6/23/23, 5:16 PM - Christopher Ginting: Katya are there any other photos of you other than the ones you sent on the gc and the one where you're on your own table?
6/23/23, 5:17 PM - Christopher Ginting: I can't find them
6/23/23, 5:18 PM - Christopher Ginting: Also I know this sounds like a negative comment but it really isn't but why don't you smile with your teeth?
6/23/23, 5:19 PM - Christopher Ginting: You deleted this message
6/23/23, 5:19 PM - Christopher Ginting: that sounds so weird
6/23/23, 5:21 PM - Christopher Ginting: corrected version: We all want to see katya's biiiiig smile
6/23/23, 5:21 PM - Christopher Ginting: it's probably contagious
6/23/23, 6:06 PM - Angry Board Gamer: No I don’t think so
6/23/23, 6:06 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Ok well basically
6/23/23, 6:06 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Idk I just feel like I look better smiling without my teeth idk
6/23/23, 6:06 PM - Angry Board Gamer: It’s just like a habit I guess?
6/23/23, 6:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: Ah okay then
6/23/23, 6:06 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Also it’s kinda weird for me to smile with my teeth for photos cause I hate holding it yk?
6/23/23, 6:07 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Like it feels fake unless I’m like laughing or smth
6/23/23, 6:07 PM - Christopher Ginting: I've had a moderate overbite for almost my entire life
6/23/23, 6:07 PM - Christopher Ginting: so I feel compelled to show my teeth
6/23/23, 6:07 PM - Christopher Ginting: because they just wanna get out of there lmao
6/23/23, 6:08 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Idk for me I’m a bit self conscious sometimes but it really depends
6/23/23, 6:08 PM - Christopher Ginting: What depends?
6/23/23, 6:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Like on the situation cause if I’m smiling with my teeth for a photo on purpose it feels fake and I feel like I look rlly weird but if it’s candid it’s ok I guess
6/23/23, 6:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: Oh same then
6/23/23, 6:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I just prefer the way I look smiling without my teeth
6/23/23, 6:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: Actually I used to have a similar problem but a few things happened
6/23/23, 6:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: well not problem
6/23/23, 6:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: situation
6/23/23, 6:10 PM - Christopher Ginting: a. my mom tells me to smile with my teeth
6/23/23, 6:10 PM - Christopher Ginting: b. i'm actually happy enough to not fake smile when I'm with my friends
6/23/23, 6:11 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Ok cause for me I do smile without my teeth normally sometimes but naturally I smile with my teeth too but posing for photos it’s always the former idk if that makes sense
6/23/23, 6:11 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Your smile is really nice though!!
6/23/23, 6:12 PM - Christopher Ginting: Yeah it's not that I'm suggesting you're unhappy I was just putting my situation out there
6/23/23, 6:13 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Oh cool no worries
6/23/23, 6:13 PM - Christopher Ginting: Thanks, should this change my decision to get invisalign in about a month and a half?
6/23/23, 6:13 PM - Christopher Ginting: It shouldn't right

6/24/23, 1:08 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Teen town sounds like the kind of bops they play in Pokémon when you’re fighting the gym leaders and I mean that in the best way possible
6/24/23, 1:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: Birdland was the thing my drums teacher tried to test me with once
6/24/23, 1:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: with the sign reading
6/24/23, 1:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: because it's fairly simple
6/24/23, 1:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: but the one hard thing about it is the time signatures
6/24/23, 1:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: sight*
6/24/23, 1:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Wow that’s fun sight reading sounds tough
6/24/23, 1:10 PM - Christopher Ginting: It is and thank you (lmao)

6/24/23, 1:11 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I use it to study to sometimes
6/24/23, 1:11 PM - Angry Board Gamer: But only if I’m super focused
6/24/23, 1:11 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Otherwise I’ve got to listen to like one hour loops of mother mother
6/24/23, 1:12 PM - Christopher Ginting: Mother mother?

6/24/23, 1:18 PM - Christopher Ginting: ?
6/24/23, 1:18 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Yeah so kili is normally in the kitchen and we have like a back room that’s set up for them and ozai is in the hall
6/24/23, 1:19 PM - Angry Board Gamer: So we put them in their cages at night and ozai has a hall cage for when we’re eating or if we have to go out
6/24/23, 1:19 PM - Christopher Ginting: What bout kili
6/24/23, 1:20 PM - Angry Board Gamer: <Media omitted>
6/24/23, 1:20 PM - Angry Board Gamer: And at night they go into their cages in here
6/24/23, 1:20 PM - Christopher Ginting: Oh no
6/24/23, 1:20 PM - Christopher Ginting: what did ozai do
6/24/23, 1:20 PM - Christopher Ginting: to deserve the c a g e
6/24/23, 1:20 PM - Christopher Ginting: for he eating
6/24/23, 1:20 PM - Christopher Ginting: my question is
6/24/23, 1:21 PM - Christopher Ginting: why does ozai get a cage for going out or eating but kili doesn't
6/24/23, 1:21 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Csuse kili has the kitchen area which is like safe for him if ozai is in the hall when no one is home we’re scared he’ll bite a wire or smth dangerous
6/24/23, 1:22 PM - Angry Board Gamer: It would be the other way but ozai would wreck the dishwasher/ washing machine / dryer
6/24/23, 1:22 PM - Angry Board Gamer: And he likes the hall he sits on the chairs and couches a lot
6/24/23, 1:22 PM - Christopher Ginting: So ozai is just naughty
6/24/23, 1:22 PM - Christopher Ginting: Is he?
6/24/23, 1:22 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Yea pretty much
6/24/23, 1:22 PM - Christopher Ginting: I want to know about the birds' perosnalities
6/24/23, 1:23 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Also he’s bigger so he’s waaay more destructive
6/24/23, 1:23 PM - Angry Board Gamer: They’re both assholes but they’re so entertaining
6/24/23, 1:23 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Ok so like ozai was rlly shy when we first got him and we thought he was quiet turns out he’s crazy and needed to get comfortable first
6/24/23, 1:24 PM - Christopher Ginting: That's soooooooo cute
6/24/23, 1:24 PM - Angry Board Gamer: And kili is equally evil like he’ll bite and stuff but he’s more cuddly
6/24/23, 1:24 PM - Christopher Ginting: SO YOU CAN JUST HUG THE BIRB?
6/24/23, 1:25 PM - Angry Board Gamer: If he’s in a good mood yes
6/24/23, 1:25 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Not ozai he’ll Jill you
6/24/23, 1:25 PM - Angry Board Gamer: *kill

7/1/23, 6:06 PM - Christopher Ginting: Ok she's a science youtuber but she had a pretty controversial stance on hydrogen as a fuel source
7/1/23, 6:07 PM - Christopher Ginting: basically she thinks that hydrogen isn't as clean and whatnot as everyone says it is
7/1/23, 6:07 PM - Christopher Ginting: not discrediting ur internship tho its rly cool just thought it was relevant
7/1/23, 6:07 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Yeah I mean I guess it’s that it’s cleaner than what we use now
7/1/23, 6:07 PM - Angry Board Gamer: But sounds it design
7/1/23, 6:07 PM - Angry Board Gamer: *intwrwsotng
7/1/23, 6:07 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Interesting
7/1/23, 6:07 PM - Christopher Ginting: She said it was only cleaner by like 7% or something
7/1/23, 6:08 PM - Christopher Ginting: because the source of hydrogen is from fossil fuels right now
7/1/23, 6:08 PM - Christopher Ginting: which is terribly ironic
7/1/23, 6:08 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Yeah hahaha
7/1/23, 6:08 PM - Christopher Ginting: the alternatives that are available right now are actual underground hydrogen (rare) or water processing byproduct (expensive and also polluting)
7/1/23, 6:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: but tell me about it
7/1/23, 6:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: whatchu gonna do
7/1/23, 6:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Like to prep??
7/1/23, 6:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: Sure
7/1/23, 6:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Ohh
7/1/23, 6:09 PM - Christopher Ginting: but also what do you do in an internship
7/1/23, 6:09 PM - Angry Board Gamer: You meant like in the internship

7/2/23, 8:31 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I don’t fully know they’re gonna make me help ppl cause it’s not long enough to do a project, and so I’ll be helping with all the engineering stuff as well as other random jobs
7/2/23, 8:31 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Like organising business cards
7/2/23, 8:31 PM - Angry Board Gamer: That was tue example they gave haha
7/2/23, 8:31 PM - Christopher Ginting: Surely there's something better than that right 😱
7/2/23, 8:31 PM - Christopher Ginting: Actually I don't know what internships are like maybe that's par for the course
7/2/23, 8:32 PM - Angry Board Gamer: No it’s actually quite good csuse I’m gonna be helping with a lot of soldering and jobs like that
7/2/23, 8:32 PM - Christopher Ginting: Ohhh okay that's good I thought your job will be to organise cards
7/2/23, 8:33 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Hahaha yeah I was scared too during the interview but from what my brother said all interns have to do some stuff like that csuse it’s a startup but I mainly get to do the engineering stuff
7/2/23, 8:33 PM - Angry Board Gamer: I’ll update you once I’ve gone though!
7/2/23, 8:33 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Im starting on Tuesday hehe
7/2/23, 8:33 PM - Christopher Ginting: Dayummmm
7/2/23, 8:33 PM - Christopher Ginting: I feel left out 😢
7/2/23, 8:33 PM - Christopher Ginting: Coping hard in the meantime
7/2/23, 8:34 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Noooo
7/2/23, 8:34 PM - Angry Board Gamer: With what?
7/2/23, 8:34 PM - Christopher Ginting: Laughing at louis' language model
7/2/23, 8:34 PM - Christopher Ginting: you wanna hear bout it?
7/2/23, 8:34 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Yes pls
7/2/23, 8:34 PM - Christopher Ginting: Want the dorky details boiled down or given raw?
7/2/23, 8:35 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Hmm whatever you want I’m ok with either
7/2/23, 8:35 PM - Christopher Ginting: Okay
7/2/23, 8:35 PM - Christopher Ginting: Well Louis made a language model with the tensor nodes n stuff basically its his own chatgpt
7/2/23, 8:35 PM - Christopher Ginting: but
7/2/23, 8:35 PM - Christopher Ginting: to make language models you need to train it on data
7/2/23, 8:35 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Oh cool
7/2/23, 8:36 PM - Christopher Ginting: chatgpt trained it on a kajillion bytes of data
7/2/23, 8:36 PM - Christopher Ginting: Louis trained it on this discord server
7/2/23, 8:36 PM - Christopher Ginting: which has me in it and other true gamers 😎
7/2/23, 8:36 PM - Christopher Ginting: the problem with training a model on gamers is that it will speak like gamers
7/2/23, 8:37 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Oh I see where this is going
7/2/23, 8:37 PM - Christopher Ginting: and gamers are not so well known for their coherence
7/2/23, 8:37 PM - Christopher Ginting: they are ALSO not well known for their kindness or compassion
7/2/23, 8:37 PM - Christopher Ginting: so he's posting the results of him 'chatting' with the model and it's so hilarious
7/2/23, 8:37 PM - Angry Board Gamer: Pls pls pls send them i need to see this
7/2/23, 8:38 PM - Christopher Ginting: Okok
